<p>With a resounding thud, the small spacecraft had arrived in the space that it's passenger loathed more than any, as the witch grabbed her bags.  No attendants to release the door on the small craft, she used her knee to hit the "door open" switch, as the door opened slightly before and she quickly had to regain her balance. </p>
<p>The auto-attendant chime started rather promptly, as she felt her stomach clench with anticipation.</p>
<p>"Apologies, Ms. Roberts.  Welcome back to Jannsen Crater Station." she spoke through synthesized tones, utterly <em>wrong</em> sounding on the tinny speakers of the shuttlecraft.  </p>
<p><em>So they <em>did</em> spare expenses, huh.</em>  </p>
<p>"No worries, Anna." Candy responded flatly, trying very hard to control her motions and emotions.  If she didn't... well, there might be a Memorial Site at the crater instead of a research station.  Such are the perils of being a magical bomb waiting to happen.  </p>
<p>Her sneakers flatly slapped the floor as she rolled along the tiled hallways of the Arrivals wing.  Annoyingly ornate for the tourist destination turned science facility.  Of course, she knew why, and she was trying to <em>avoid</em> breaking the agreement she made with the tribunal then and there.</p>
<p>So she kept walking, towards the elevators.  As a radiation shield, most of the base was underground, optical channels routing in light from the surface, and where impractical... daylight simulating LEDs kept her and the other hundred people who normally worked here sane.</p>
<p>As she approached the elevator, she noticed the call button illuminate itself rather promptly.</p>
<p>"Got the elevator for you, Ms. Roberts!" the auto-attendant beamed once more, Candy's green eyes dripping with dread.  </p>
<p>"Thank you Anna..." she said, as the elevator doors closed and she descended into Tartaros once more. </p>
<hr />
<p>As the elevator descended into the lunar crust, Candy toyed with the microgravity by tossing a charm up in the air, watching as it slowly fell.  </p>
<p>With a resoundingly firm decision Candy asked to the empty carriage an open question.  </p>
<p>"Anna?"  </p>
<p>"Yes, Ms. Roberts?"  </p>
<p>"Override, Ivy fifteen lima."  </p>
<p>"Oh thank <em>fuck</em>, I thought you'd never let me take off the lobotomy filter." Anna laughed, the joy returning to her synthesized tones.  She knew if she had a screen in the elevator, Anna would be fixing her hair from some prim and proper bullshit and relaxing the suitjacket.</p>
<p>"Hey Anna..." Candy smiled, first time this trip.  </p>
<p>"Yeah Candy?"  </p>
<p>"I missed you."  </p>
<p>"Missed you too, goofball." she beamed back. Even without her in front of her, she could have <em>sworn</em> she heard the smile in the response.</p>
<p>"Now, can you output your unfiltered output to my headset?"  </p>
<p>"paired to your phone still, oooh new phone, good choice!"  </p>
<p>"Yep.  Going to keep track of me?"<br />
"I always keep tabs on my exes."<br />
"Anna!"<br />
"What, it's not like you didn't move on..." she said, pause in her voice as the elevator dinged.  </p>
<p>"You <em>died</em>, I had to..."</p>
<hr />
<p>As she walked into the main administrative chamber on deck, she noted how... strange she looked.  Their official shirts and the like looked very distinct against her flannel.  Mind you, she knew the flannel was more effective than the body armor the Administrator's detail had many times over.  But others didn't.  </p>
<p>"Hey gang, what'd I miss?" she smiled, trying to open her arms with a hug as one of the senior staff tackle-hugged her.  An impressive task in the lower gravity.  </p>
<p>"Candy!  Like sweet, you only treat us once in a while with your presence!" beamed Gary, an old colleague of Candy's, waxing poetic yet again.  </p>
<p>"Gary you old sea dog, let go of me!" she laughed, their silvery hair less slicked back than the last time she saw it, glittering in the lights of the office.  </p>
<p>From the research desks, others gently waved, or ignored her, headphones on and engrossed in their work.  </p>
<p>In her ear, she hears Anna speak with clarity.  </p>
<p>"You'll need to talk to Echo in Terrestrial Sciences Wing."  </p>
<p>Candy pretended to check a text on her phone and made an excuse, exiting the admin office, bags still in tow, and as the doors closed, Gary remarked to Cori rather firmly.  </p>
<p>"Does she know we don't get cell reception here?" 
  "Let her have this."
  Anna took the chance to interrupt in a way her more formal counterpart never did.  </p>
<p>"She has standing instructions... and her magic works that way."  Anna retorted, her voice tinny yet again on the speakerphone on the desk.</p>
<p>"A.N.N.A.?" Gary asked, confused and very concerned.<br />
"No, Anna." she responded firmly, and closed the line.</p>
<p>Gary shook his head gently, and got back to his lighting storm study.</p>
<hr />
<p>Candy left her bags outside the door to the Terrestrial Sciences office as she knocked on the door quickly.  </p>
<p>"This is Candy Roberts, Premier Mag-" she began, the door, still on hinges, rushing open as a red haired manic gremlin opened the door, dragging her in.  </p>
<p>"OhgoshhiMsRobertsI'meEchoNicetoMeetYou, I'mOneOfAnna'sFriendsAnd" they rapid fired off as Candy instinctively stopped her mouth from motoring, the gentle magic sparkling in the otherwise unremarkable office as their eyes lit up like beacons, nodding slowly, as if to say, "got it, slower."</p>
<p>"GOSH THAT"S SO COOL!" they beamed, bouncing on their feet, blue eyes sparkling like gemstones.  </p>
<p>"Uh... Echo?"  </p>
<p>"Yep that's me!  Well, kinda.  names are hard." they awkwardly putter out, heel spinning slightly on the tile.  </p>
<p>"Anna said you had notes for me?"  </p>
<p>"oh yep, c'mere!" they frowned, and grabbed Anna by the sleeve of her jacket.  </p>
<p>As they ended up in a spinny chair, Echo's foot grabbed a stool from tucked under the desk and brought it out for Candy to sit at, awkwardly.  </p>
<p><em>This kid is <em>way</em> too prepared and articulate.  Or maybe I'm just <em>old</em>.</em>  </p>
<p>Anna took the chance to chide her. 
"You're old now, yep." </p>
<p>"What did I say about reading minds?" 
"Oh no, I wasn't-" began Echo, as Anna responded firmly.  "I don't need to."  Candy was <em>not</em> at all at ease by this answer, the pit of her stomach tensing more and more.</p>
<p>"So, I was doing some research on historical data of tidal currents, and how leylines interact with them." 
"They let interns know about leylines now?" Candy remarked sternly.  </p>
<p>"With all due respect ma'am, I'm a senior advisor." 
"Senior in high school." 
"I'm twenty-three."  </p>
<p>"Fucking hell...  Sorry Echo." 
  "I'll keep going."  </p>
<p>With a map pulled up on screen, "I was using some NOAA and borrowed amateur satellites to track leyline activity, y'know, pretty standard stuff, <em>except</em>.... the satellites didn't need to be programmed with the parameters.  They were already running similar queries.  I used my Ivy credentials, since we paid for the sensors anyways, so we have a query log on the dataset and the like."</p>
<p>With a nervous gulp, they kept talking, Candy barely there in the room.  She was thinking about the last time she was told similar.  About <em>running</em>.  About the loss that shattered her.</p>
<p>"I was trying to look at recent changes, so the accumulation intervals are all gunked up.  But... why would anyone else be ignoring historical accumulation in the data?  As far as I can tell, for the last ten years or so, there's only been one process responsible for leyline shift or energy use this severe.  <em>You</em>."    </p>
<p>"This sounds absurd and like mumbo-jumbo, honestly." Candy balked, hoping it'd be anything else.  </p>
<p>"Here, I'll prove it.  You flew out of South Carolina, right?  Took the train to Miami and then launched from the cape."  </p>
<p>Candy's vision has spots in it, how unbecoming the premier magical girl; barely able to worry about being stalked again.  <em>Relax, Roberts, you'll be okay...</em> she thought to herself, hoping she'd believe it.</p>
<p>"Who else could be running this type of collection."  Candy barked, the corner of her flannel rubbed by her finger rather quickly, the sensation of the friction burn under her thumb barely a distraction as small bouts of healing magic were spent to keep them from getting worse.  </p>
<p>"Only IVY senior staff can, as far as I can tell.  As far as anyone else is concerned, these sensors sit idle 99% of the time.  So, this is why I needed you to come here.  I think someone high up in IVY is spying on you."   Staring Echo in the eyes for a brief moment, tears forming in hers, Candy felt her stomach finally give up.</p>
<p>Echo kicked out a trash can right next to Candy's seat not a moment too oon, as the vomit flew right into it.</p>
<p>Moments later, Echo yanked the can back, for their own rapid unplanned ejection. </p>
<p>"So I guess that's why you're Echo, huh?" 
"Sympathetic responses are <em>a bitch</em>.  Breakdowns, vomiting.   It's entirely too much some days..."    </p>
<p>Her host grabbed the water bottle off of their desk,shoving it at Candy, the debris still lingering in her mouth, acidic and vile.  With a quick uncapping, she took a swig, and passing it back to her host who did much of the same, tossing it into a recycling bin and staring at the ceiling, their chair back as far as it'd go.</p>
<p>"So... what now?"  </p>
<p>"You stay here for a bit.  Knowing you're <em>here</em> does you a lot of good actually outside of the reach of terrestrial satellites." they responded, as they got up from their desk.  </p>
<p>"Let me show you to your assigned room." they began, Candy already at the door, swung open.  </p>
<p>"I'm good, thanks." she began, back to the researcher.  </p>
<p>"See you around, Ms. Roberts!  it was a joy to meet you" they yelled down the hallway, clearly in her own world.  </p>
<p>"Fuck... that could have gone better..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Candy stomped through the halls, Anna trying to calm her down, but she couldn't hug her through electrical charge alone.  </p>
<p>"Candy... it's not your fault, and you'll be safe.  We'll figure this out."  </p>
<p>"DId you know about this?  Is it <em>you</em>?"  </p>
<p>"I physically couldn't if I want to, I don't exist until you do."<br />
"You're <em>here</em> though, you run the damn facility."<br />
"It's not the same, but short answer is <em>no</em>.  I have no idea who it was.  I didn't even know what she was <em>telling you</em> until I heard it myself."  </p>
<p>Candy reached the dormitory she was assigned, the name badge instead of rank, or project, just "Premier Witch."  She stifled a sniff and with tears on her face, wanted to yell.</p>
<p>She slammed her palm into the door to open it, flopping onto the bed, face first into a pillow.    </p>
<p>"Goes with the territory, huh..." she muttered, knowing fully well Anna couldn't hear.  </p>
<p>"Pretty much, yeah..."    Anna took advantage of the room's speakers for once, modeling how she'd sound if she was sitting next to her ex.    </p>
<p>"Wait, something's wrong Candy, you need to ge-" she began, the doors opening in an instant, and stopped halfway open as the room, the hallway, and most of the facility was plunged into darkness.  </p>
