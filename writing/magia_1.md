She couldn't sleep.  No, she *wouldn't* sleep, the thoughts that kept her up demanding her attention even in rest.

And so, she had nightmares.  Dreams maybe, but nightmares too.  Incomprehensible shapes, amorphous and intimidating.  Raw emotional potential sang in a perverse duet, anxiety and dread attuned to the distortions of her own psyche.

The sun was rising, and she was just getting to bed.

"It's not normal to have nightmares like this, is it?"

"Nothing about our lives is normal now."

"You know what I meant!"

"Tsk!"
