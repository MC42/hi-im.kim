<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>And as the triumphant hero stumbled into the crypt, chosen sword and shield in hand, he found his party, his steed... locked out.  </p>
<p>"Who goes there!" he yelled, his voice reflecting back off of him in the dimmed halls of the former church.  He suspected foul play, but even he should have known better.  </p>
<p>"You do!" echoed back, his own voice fainter against the combs.  </p>
<p>"Am I losing it...."  he whispered, advancing slowly, as the candles ahead of him ignited promptly, an altar of sorts revealed.  What once was the pulpit of a fire and brimstone preacher had been... converted.  A large dusty frame covered in velvety red cloth lay there, dusty, as pieces of clothing, books, notes, swords, shields, and more lay just as dormant.  </p>
<p>It looked like the doorway to a tomb, and he felt his gut clench as he marched forward, gently placing his shield down.
</p>
<p>"Too many have vanished here, I've come to put their souls to rest!" he stated factually, his own caramel brown eyes swamped with grief.  And with that, he tore the mirror off, the red cloth clattering over top of the shields, a few candles blowing out in the process, moonlight streaming through the frame.  </p>
<p>He found himself staring at a mirror.  But... not a logical one.  The chocolate eyes and soft face, the short-cut hair in a dirtied suit of armor belonged to a lady in front of him.  His loyal sword in <em>her</em> hand, and he felt himself relax, then tense, and utterly wail.  </p>
<p>"How are you me?  Show yourself foul witch!" he barked, hearing <em>her</em> voice back at him.  </p>
<p>"Ah, you silly silly man.  You think that I am someone that isn't you."  she said softly, her laughter kindhearted.

  "You are stealing-"

    "I am not touching your memories, Lady Christine.  I <em>am</em> your memories."
</p>
<p>The words bothered him immensely, because he watched her drop the sword.  He didn't recall doing so, but in looking down he saw it with his shield and the mirror cloth, impossible.</p>
<p>And so he collapsed onto the steps too, the figure stepping through the mirror to comfort him.  </p>
<p>"And we are..."<br />
  "Me, yes."<br />
  "But I am <em>this</em> me."<br />
  "But you have not always been this you.  This you is not the true you."<br />
  "And you would know?"<br />
  "More than you."<br />
  "So the first maiden we saved?"<br />
  "Envy."<br />
  "The first time we took a job of knight?"<br />
  "Self-loathing."<br />
  "My own self image?"<br />
  "Others image of you."  </p>
<p>"But surely there is no easy way..." they said, sadly, as their friend grabbed their arm and pulled them back up, clothing under armor fitting differently than it had as they had entered the chamber.  </p>
<p>"There are other worlds than this one.  One where you have always been this maiden Christine."  </p>
<p>"But why can it not be this one?" she sobbed, her own tears streaming down a softer face.  </p>
<p>And so, her doppelganger found herself saying the words of triviality and commitment she knew too well.  </p>
<p>"As you wish."  </p>
<p>And thustly, she was alone,candles crackling quietly in the moonlight through an empty frame.  And understood why so many had gone missing.  She left her armor for the next past future prince, and hoped it'd serve him better than her own armor had.</p>
