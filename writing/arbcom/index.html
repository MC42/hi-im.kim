<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P3"> "It is nice to know that the universe is self‐consistent enough to handle a few small exploits, a few violations of its laws here and there, without falling apart entirely. After all, when you have all of reality to run, what's a few ontological paradoxes among friends?"</div>
<p class="paragraph-P5">---§---</p>
<p class="paragraph-P3">“The complete disappearance of the Galileo-µ colony is a tragedy of enormous significance.  Despite the resounding effects of the scenario encountered in Kepler-37, our best and brightest cannot conclusively establish a root cause for the colony’s disappearing act.  While quite a few suspect it was wormhole-related, and some would attribute it to the instability of the entire sector, some <i>better informed </i>as of late suspect it had something to do with a wish.” </p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P6">August was no stranger to the sound of gunfire, after all, it’d been her alarm clock for what felt like years.  Staring blurry-eyed at the horizon, she found exactly what she expected, quietly resigned at the unarguable reality.  Staring back at her was an inky-black sky, not a single star in sight.  Through gritted teeth, she shook her sister, June, awake, the girl bleary-eyed and squinting through the dust-filled air.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P7">“Is it morning…?” June mumbled, her curly mop of hair threatening to obscure her vision.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P7">“Something like that.  C’mon.” August smiled back, her glasses hiding the bags under her eyes as well as any could.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P8">The two of them snuck through the debris field as carefully as they could, their gray coveralls the same color as the rubble.  Methodical steps, one after the other, took them through the collapsed surroundings.  They couldn’t afford the bravado that others their age might’ve, and were significantly more fragile, even with the myriad of implants and upgrades that percolated to the outer colonies.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P9">August grasped at the edge of a streetlight, knowing based on the shape of the dome that they found a subway entrance.  Despite the lack of other obvious signage, she figured it was as clear a sign as they’d get.  If they could sneak through the entrance, they’d be able to get somewhere safe, to find loved ones.  August hoped desperately that Galileo survived.  All they had to do was wait for the train.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P10">As August climbed past concrete boulders, alloy reinforcements still jutting through the wreckage like barbs, she didn’t once let go of June’s hand.  They were safer together, after all, despite the occasional mis-step.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P11">The stairs to the station were utterly charred, detonated explosives spalling the concrete, the damage only waning once they descended the final stairwell onto the platform itself.  It seemed that, despite the efforts of the Ceph, this station had survived intact, and in fairly good shape, dust notwithstanding.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P11">The tunnels that cross-connected the planet were carved from the rock-face, stitches beneath the surface, struggling to keep the world together.  The speed of the trains traversing them left a hollow wind sweeping through the station, a constant breeze keeping them company while they waited.  While a station normally had platform gates, any that might’ve been present were removed in the days and months after the world vanished.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P12">August had ridden the train with her parents enough to know about the wind, June too young to remember it as anything more than a dream.  A dream from when stars still shone in the sky.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P13">June couldn’t help but shudder in the wind, colder for it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P14">“I don’t like this…”  June murmured, her sister squeezing her hand tighter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P15">“Me neither Juney, but you gotta be strong, okay?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P15">“Easy for you to say!  You’re older!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P16">August couldn’t help but laugh a little.  “I may be older but that doesn’t make it easier.” neglecting to continue the thought<i>.  Besides.  At least you don’t have to remember Mom and Dad so vividly.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P17">As she stood on the platform, hoping that June couldn’t see her face through her own hair tossed in the wind, she heard the gentle rumble of the train in the distance.  The tunnel walls echoed, making every interaction of the track and wheel resonate as if a drum, as August heard the carriage begin deceleration in the distance.  The tracks sung in harmony with the speed of the car as the brakes “plucked” their guides; a steel alloy guitar string hundreds of kilometers long.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P18">Through distorted speakers, the automated announcement system spat out in Standard a crackling, crunching message, distorted through what must’ve been damaged speakers.  “This is an Express, Pink Line Train to New Florence.  First stop will be, Chapel Hill.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P19">The girls got on, their worn sneakers crossing from the weathered concrete into the comparatively pristine carriage, dust settling in their footsteps.  It wasn’t hard to find a seat, the train deserted spare them, every seat an option.  As the doors sealed with a pleasant chime, the lighting inside the carriage flickering slightly as the motors hummed to life.  With a lurch, and then the discordant tone of the motors accelerating, their train careened through the dark towards New Florence.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P20">As the carriage continued its feverish pace into the subterranean void, rocking gently on the tracks, June couldn’t help but nod off.  It was the most comfortable place they’d been in weeks, and it had <i>HVAC</i>.  August reached into her knapsack and pulled out a water bottle, the seal of her parent’s workplace still emblazoned on the bottom, corroding in the uncontrolled ecosystem.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P20">Still, as far as August was concerned, this was luxury.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P21">I hope that things are better in New Florence.  Maybe they’ll use words and not gunfire.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P22">As she stared through the discolored front window of the carriage, she found herself staring at a bullethole she hadn’t noticed in the station, aimed up towards the ceiling.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P23"><i>Or at least, </i><i>not</i><i> </i><i>exclusively gunfire</i>, August silently prayed to no one in particular.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P13">“So we’ve got Halley and Brahm moved to Nova Si<i>cilia</i>, are we forgetting anyone?”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P25">“We could go back for Galileo, they <i>are</i> the colony’s namesake.   Could encourage their<i> peers</i> to cooperate.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P25">“Galileo retired, boss.  Like, a day or two before we got sent into this hellhole.  We don’t need to get ‘em.  As far as their peers are concerned, they’re probably dead anyways.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P26">The girl paused for a moment, fidgeting with a ring on her finger, hoping that her subordinates wouldn’t notice.  If they <i>did</i>, she’d deal with it with the only tools she had left; force.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P25">“Fine.  But you better check in a week or two if the datacenter is <i>fully</i> destroyed.  Last thing we need is someone to spread rumors, <i>especially</i> some spread by Governance sentients.”</div>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P27">A pleasant chime woke August up, and she found the point of a spear hovering centimeters from her nose.  A spear held still by a girl in a frilly costume, looking slightly older than August.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P28">A magical girl.  Of course.  This is MSY territory, or… Church territory?  Is there a difference?</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P29">“Who <i>are</i> you?” the girl balked, her hair kept neatly in twin ponytails, a pale orange skirt matching the ends of her hair, her eyes a deeper amber, and of course, her <i>soul gem </i>shone in the same shade.  The girl was trying her best to be threatening, but, August was still <i>slightly taller</i>, despite the mage’s heels.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P29">“Uh.  I’m August-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P29">“Wrong question I guess.  Why are you <i>here.</i>” she demanded, August wearily standing her ground as June shrunk behind her slightly.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P29">“Safety hopefully. We grew up on the outskirts of Bergen, which-”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P29">“Was destroyed in the Ceph attack...” the magical girl finished, her spear dissolving as easily as she’d summoned it.  Her posture faltered for a moment, staring past the girls into the interior of the carriage, August realizing suddenly there were two more magical girls on the outside of the carriage.  A glance to the front of the train found her staring at a nervous rail system worker, the older man holding an override button at the staff gate towards the end of the station.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P29">“We’ve been trying to get to somewhere safe, and a few folks we found on the outskirts points us in the right direction, most of the other trains broke down though, so we had to go on foot until we… got here I guess.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P30">Through a silent and exasperated sigh, the magical girl around and walked out of the car, waving the two girls standing guard to follow her.  The mechanical operator released the hold button, the traincar slowly rolling to the next stop.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P31">Isn’t waving those magical girls to follow on a little superfluous?  They can telepathically talk, right..?</div>
<p class="paragraph-P32">As they ascended the stairs, their once-aggressor pulled out a keyring from an unseen pocket of her skirt, methodically opening a door labeled “Staff Only | D&amp;E” with the twist of a key, descending into what August <i>hoped </i>was just a maintenance pathway.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">As August turned the corner of the catwalk, June turned around to look at the open door, the two guards looking at her with the faintest hints of pity as the door closed, the lock clicking shut behind them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P33">They snaked their way through back tunnels, walkways barely tall enough for them, girders and spans decaying slightly in the environment less controlled as some of it revealed sunlight, cascading down the practically incandescent cavern walls, the red bouncing back up off the floor, casting distorted shadows on the far wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“So uh-” August started, the girl in front of her not acknowledging her talking.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“Where are we going?” she asked, the wall as responsive as their escort, before finally responding.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“Somewhere safe.” the magical girl said in a defeated tone.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“I thought all of New Florence <i>wa</i>s safe?” August cautiously raised, the girl’s posture deflating slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“It is!” she snipped, continuing before her<i> companions </i>had a chance to respond.  <i> “</i>Or rather… it <i>was</i> like that.  For a while anyways.  We can’t just take in every single sob-story that comes our way.  Some want to hurt others.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P34">Even June couldn’t ignore the undertones, the barely-veiled threat.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P35">Others who we took mercy on betrayed us.  Don’t make the same mistake.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P36">The silence hung heavy in the air, punctuated largely by the pipework, the crunch of gravel under foot, and winces as they ducked and weaved through the maze of tunnels.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P37">June was tired of the rattle of pipes and the arrhythmic thud of footsteps being the only sounds in the air, and decided to test their <i>guide</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P37">“Why is this place so old?  It feels like something ancient, something <i>cursed</i>.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P38">The magical girl turned to face them as she responded, almost taking pride in the knowledge.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P39">“You’re a smart kid, ya know?  It’s older than you’d think.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P40">June couldn’t help but smile before the orange-hued girl continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P39"> “New Florence is like old Florence in that way.  Layers on layers, y’know?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P41">“Uh… no.” June mumbled, her smile mired by confusion, hoping the pretty lady wouldn’t mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P41">August realized with an all-too-embarrassing epiphany that the magical girl was distrustful of them because she just had <i>nothing to go on.</i>  They were all too on edge.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P38">After what felt like an eternity, and several dozen more turns, their escort was the one to open a conversation, a proverbial white flag in their cold war of sulking.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P42">“It’s only fair you know where we’re going, I <i>did hold you at spear-point, </i><i>after all.</i><i>” </i>the magical girl admitted, hoping they’d take the hint.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P38">“Hmpf.” June responded, August trying to shrug it off on her behalf.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P43">I earned that one I guess.  Nobody here takes kindly to being woken up at weapon-range.  Still, had to be careful.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P42">“I’m taking you through the tunnels to MSY District.  You said you were running, do you have family here?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P44">“Uh… kinda?  We were adopted in <i>Nova Si</i><i>c</i><i>ilia </i>by the Kisakis but…” August trailed off, catching the gaze of the magical girl, her eyes dimly glowing in the dark, amber gems in the unrelenting void.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">She didn’t need to finish the sentence, the guilt weighed on her enough that she visibly deflated as the sentence trailed off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P46">“Okay.” their guide mused, expecting something of the sort.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P47">The trio exited a door through another locked doorway, finding themselves in a sterile, but <i>human friendly </i>hallway.  A far cry from the proto-catacombs they’d been in just prior, August couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P46">“For the time being then, you’re staying with me.” she smiled, the door at the end of the hallway unlocking and opening itself.  As August and June passed the doorframe, they couldn’t help but read the names on the door. In both Human Standard and Japanese kanji the sign scribbled “Karina &amp; Shannon Luhr”, June trying to hide a smile at the handwriting, her face washed over with awe as she entered the home.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P48">They saw a kitchen with a full island, couches in a sprawling living room, one overflowing with all sorts of plush animals.  Karina briefly mentioned the multiple private bedrooms, guest rooms, tall ceilings, a <i>dedicated study</i>.  The Luhr household was luxurious by most standards, but August was most surprised by the <i>food.</i>  She had spices, and flours, all sorts of luxury goods.  Stuff from before the collapse, stuff that was practically <i>unheard of </i>on this rock.  Saffron, jasmine, liquors and more, a collection that’d cause wars a few hundred years prior, just sitting in neatly organized containers, <i>begging</i> to be used.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P49">It felt like a <i>home, </i>not just a house.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Excuse me, miss magical girl?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Mhmm, June, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P50">The girl nodded excitedly, the magical girl a celebrity to her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“June, please call me Karina.” the girl’s inexplicably placid as she shed a black and silver overcoat, utterly useless for a magical girl like her, tucking it into the nearby closet as she walked past.  Moving past the entryway, she strayed into her living room, sitting down in an armchair methodically.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Miss Karina, can my sister make you some food?  She’s a really good cook!” June smiled, the charm turned to eleven for their savior of the hour.  Karina’s stomach couldn’t help but rumble.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Hey!” August balked, “you could have <i>asked </i>first…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P51">June could help but shrug, “You’d never say no to that… didn’t think I needed to!”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P45">“Oh, that’s not-” Karina balked.  <i>There’s no way to tell them I practically eat garbage most of the time.  That this is my wife’s house more than my own.  T</i><i>hat she might </i><i>not</i><i>-</i></div>

<div class="paragraph-P52">“Are you <i>sure,</i> Luhr-sama?  It’d be no trouble at all, especially since you’re going through the trouble of hosting us.  Please.” August beckoned, the tension rising until their host’s polite posturing collapsed.  She was <i>spent.</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P53">“Fine!  Fine.  You can cook whatever you want for yourselves, and if there’s leftovers I’ll happily take them.”  She couldn’t help but smile, the girls practically<i> ecstatic</i> at the opportunity.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P54">“I still get food from the Church or work most of the time, rations or prepped meals are far more efficient. Don’t worry if you’re too hungry to leave something for me.  I promise it’s okay.” she beamed, hoping they got the message she was trying to lay out.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P55">August couldn’t help but notice the emphasis on the word “Church”, distinct over the generic of a chapel; August refused to make a face as Karina was still in deep thought over the expected kitchen antics, trying to remember where the cleaning supplies were.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P56">No matter how bad it is, I’ll eat it.  Goddess knows I’ve made worse for Shannon, and eaten worse in combat.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P52">“Thank you, Ms. Karina!” June giddily balked, as Mrs. Luhr found herself nursing a headache.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P52">“I’m going to lay down for a bit." she mumbled, her face obscuring her head as she gingerly got to her feet, using the wall as a guide as she slowly ascended the steps to the half-landing.  “There’s clothes in the bedroom next to mine, something should fit both of you, toss your laundry in the hamper next to the bathroom.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P52">“Thank you again, Luhr-sama!” August and June said in unison, looking at the kitchen’s pantry with glee, August pulling out an actual<i> paper and ink cookbook</i><i> </i>as Karina collapsed into bed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P57">Goddess-damnit.  Why do I keep taking in strays? </p>
<p class="paragraph-P58">She pulled open a drawer and pulled out grief cubes, her soul gem murky.  Such was the cost of navigating the maze of tunnels under the city.  She’d paid that penalty more than once, but this much depletion was <i>sloppy,</i> even by her <i>admittedly</i> waning standards.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P57">Know the enemy, keep it together.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P59">Karina woke to the smell of bread.  Actual bread, made the old fashioned way.  She had more than her fair share of allocs between her magical girl dispensation and Shannon’s in their shared account, but having the <i>time</i> to go and get fresh food when visiting was never really an option.  Shannon loved to surprise her, jams and breads, rolls and sandwiches.  Actual <i>non-synthesized, </i><i>handmade</i> food.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P59">As she swung her bedroom door open, she found August and June happily plodding along in the kitchen.  Two rolls of something brilliantly aromatic sat on the counter, split open already with June happily devouring a sandwich, August enjoying some toast of some kind, preserves spread across the surface.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P59">“How long was I out?” she asked, her internal chronometer happily spitting out an answer of <i>17 hours, three minutes.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P60">“It’s about mid-day so, probably like fifteen, sixteen hours?” August said, her affect a little more cheery than it had been the day before. Finally able to relax a little.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P60">“Ouch, guess I was more stressed than I thought.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P60">“I mean, who <i>wouldn’t </i>be, finding two vagrant children on a train that might’ve been a bomb or something.” August joked, a smile creeping in.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P60">“Ouch, rude!” Karina smiled back, taking it all in jest.  She had to.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">After a moment, and grabbing a slice of the bread, she nibbled on it absentmindedly for a while.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P62">It’s good.  The herbs and butter, crunch and give.  It’s delicious.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">She was so thrown off she almost didn’t notice the girls watching her enjoy the fruits of their labor, hoping so much it’d be taken well.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“You two sleep okay?” Karina mumbled, bread still in her mouth as she relished the novelty.   Still easier to get than the synthesized equivalent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“I slept like a rock…” August chirped, June groaning slightly.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P63">“I had… weird dreams.  Bleh.” June groused, knowing full well how childish it made her look.  She didn’t <i>care.</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“How so?” Karina asked, knowing full well she had nightmares too, and hoping she hadn’t given any to the kids.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Uh… there was a cat, I think?  Gunfire.  A bunch of people screaming.  And then something so big it made the sun go dark.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P64">August’s grip faltered, her sandwich slipping, if for a moment, catching it right before it hit the counter.  <i>A dream like that sounded more like…</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P65">August’s reaction caught Karina off-guard, but she was determined to not show it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P66">It was almost as if she knows how this works.  Better than she should.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“I-…  I know we got off on the wrong foot yesterday.” Luhr-sama huffed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“What an understatement…” June mumbled, Karina raising her hand slightly to protest, before falling back down.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“I… earned that one.  So, my name is Karina.  This is my home, and my wife’s of course.  I wor-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“Where is she?” August asked, Karina’s face tensing at the interruption.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P67">Another uneasy silence later, she continued, careful to not make <i>herself</i> upset.  Last thing she wanted was emotional suppression around kids.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P68">“She… died.  We think.   They’re not sure.” she muttered, her voice so quiet they could barely hear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“I’m so sorry. I-we, didn’t know.” August sputtered, June nodding along intentionally.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“Don’t be.  We both signed up for this, y’know?  She was on her way back from Kepler-37, trying to outrun it all and, she wasn’t inside before the teardrop formed.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P69">August couldn’t help but grimace, she’d kept digging and got exactly what she asked for.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P70">June raised her hand as if to answer a question in class, Karina nodding at her, expectantly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P70">“Luhr-sama, uh… how <i>old</i> are you?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P70">“June!  You can’t just <i>ask people that</i>.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P71">“No no, it’s okay.” Karina laughed.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P72">This kid is bold and nosy.  I like that.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P71">“I’m actually twenty-seven.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P70">“Wait, but you look <i>our </i>age.” August said, jaw half-agape.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P70">“Hah, I sure don’t get treated it most of the time!” Karina laughed, a weak smile floating back to the surface.  June and August were <i>disarming</i> in a way she found uncanny.  She checked for magic in the area, and found nothing unexpected.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P73">So they’re not enchanted or something.  Phew. I just got Shannon’s love of kids, which… ugh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P70">“It’s pretty common for magical girls to be older than they look, especially for the really old ones.  They can be older than most grandparents and still look like you or me.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P70">“Whoa…” June said, starry-eyed as August shaking her head briefly as she tried to focus on the tasks occupying her mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“So, what’s the plan for today then?” August asked, Karina finishing her piece of bread before grabbing another.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">Karina contemplated just sending them an itinerary for her day, before realizing for civilians it’d be nearly entirely redacted, even if it was communicable.  Not as useful as just <i>telling them </i><i>verbally</i>, even though she strictly didn’t need to.  Besides, they’re <i>kids.</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P61">“So, I gotta drop you off at the Rehousing Group, talk to Stephanie.  She’s great, and will help you two three hots and a cot, so to speak.  Plus, you’ll find out how to get involved locally.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“Okay, cool!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“Uh, Luhr-sama?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“Yes August?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“Would it be okay if I went to visit a friend first?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“Of course.  I already set an appointment for you for about four hours from now, so that should give them plenty of time.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“You’re… just gonna drop us off and then ditch?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P61">She nodded, a weak smile on her face.  “Someone’s gotta do the work still.  We’re not gonna be in here forever.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P74">August took her bag from the floor near the door and slung it over her shoulder, the well-worn vessel pressing dirt and concrete dust into the clean maroon sweater she’d borrowed from Karina’s laundry pile.  She glanced back at the interior of the living space with a hopeful look on her face, before closing the door.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P75">As they left the home, nestled between a stuffed shark and a throw pillow with a cheesy joke on it, a glassy-eyed off-white plush on the couch blinked at the door they’d just left through, and vanished.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P76">The trio found themselves staring at the door that signaled their departure from the sprawling and maze-like underground, another “D&amp;E | Staff Only” sign staring at them while Karina procured her keyring again.</div>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Luhr-sama, can I ask a question?” August piped up, Karina already a dozen steps down the catwalk.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“You already did though, what is it?” the magical girl smiled back, her eyes glowing a dim orange in the relative shade of the tunnel.  Still, the girls unable to ignore how much <i>comfortable </i>she was this trip, despite the maze of the catacombs.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Uh… how <i>is</i> the district doing?  Or like… MSY as a whole here.  Don’t get in trouble or anything but, I want to know how safe my sister is… and you I think.” August rambled, biting her tongue on the last few syllables.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“Yeah, magical girls are the thing that keeps all of us safe, so are <i>you</i> safe?” June prattled off, nearly word-for-word a poster Karina had seen on the inside of some bulkhead a tour or two ago.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P78">As June nearly bumped into her, Karina found herself a bit ashamed, reveling in the joy.  If for a moment, she got to forget there was at least <i>one</i> war on.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“So… we’re not doing great.  We met you at the station with an armed patrol, remember?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">Karina couldn’t help but reflect.  It felt <i>absurd</i> to do that, but the protocol dictated it, and there <i>was precedent.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P80">August and June nodded in unison as they recalled being woken up at spearpoint.  Rather quickly though, June found herself wearing a confused expression.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“I mean.  It did seem a bit odd though…” June warbled, “aren’t magical girls for big stuff, not just two random girls?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P77">“MSY has had folks show up like you did.  She vaporized a city block in Old City, set off a bomb of some kind.  Took us weeks to clean up the mess, a lot of people died...”</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P77">“Oh god, I’m so sorry, I didn’t-” August began, fighting her emotions as best she could.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P77">“August.  Stop <i>apologizing.</i>  You had <i>no way</i> of knowing!  It was classified and stuff, and as civilians, you don’t <i>get </i><i>access</i><i> that </i><i>info</i><i>.</i>” Karina lamented, August on the verge of tears.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“What happened to not breaking rules?” June pressed, Karina taken aback by how <i>observant</i> the girl was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“I… given the circumstances of, well… everything, we’re a bit short on staff.  We really need<i> anyone </i>we can get,  sorta like a TNC was back in the day.” Karina divulged, August’s melancholy interrupted by the absurdity of it all. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“TNC?” she asked, nose still sniffly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“Trusted Non-Contractees.” Karina responded matter-of-factly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“I thought you <i>didn’t trust us?</i>” June asked, a sour look on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“I don’t.  I mean, not entirely.  Not yet.  You gotta do a background check, but they’ll do that at Rehousing.  We check everyone now, given the circumstances.” Karina added, each addition more rushed than the last.  She didn’t even notice she was distracted until they’d already taken a wrong turn, and was now <i>very</i> confused where they were.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">“You didn’t murder me in my sleep, so you’re pretty good in my book.” she smiled, still mired with anxiety at the dizzying labyrinth in front of her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P81">Besides, you’re both contracting age.  If you’ve survived the past few months in this hellscape, you’re clever and intelligent.  We need clever just as much as we do magic right now.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P82">The girls laughed a bit, August unable to stop herself from babbling on “You didn’t hurt us either, so how bad can you <i>really be?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P83">As Karina stopped dead in her tracks, June and August bumped into her, the girl stumbling as she caught herself on the smooth rockface in front of her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P83">“Glad you trust me a little more, but I think I fucked up.” Karina admitted, the girls’ faces contorted in fear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P83">“I think we’re lost.” Karina mumbled, “I don’t know <i>how</i> but we’re lost.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P83">August reached into her bag for a flashlight as June picked a large flat rock off the ground, ready to fight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P83">“And I’ve got a feeling someone <i>else</i> is down here with us.” Karina couldn’t help but mumble, so quiet she hoped that her companions wouldn’t hear her.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Wait, how did you get <i>lost</i>, you seemed like you’ve done this a bunch!”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P84">“I <i>have!</i> But usually I’m alone, or with other magical girls.  Not just two chatty <i>civilians</i>!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P84">“Agh, I don’t like this!” June yelped</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“No shit, Socrates!  Okay, give me a second and just be quiet.  August, turn your torch off.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Why?” August balked, their only source of light in the dark’s beam jittered slightly, following the shaking of her hand.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Magical girl stuff, I swear.  Plus, it helps me focus.” Karina said, August nodding carefully.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Okay…” August gulped, turning the flashlight off and plunging the tunnel into darkness, the environment only illuminated dimly by Karina’s eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">She squeezed her hand with June tighter, the girls nervous.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Okay, we need to go back three intersections, and then up the stairs.  Follow me.” Karina stated absolutely, August flicking the flashlight back to its radiant operation, the warm glow distinct from the amber trickle they’d had moments prior.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Why did you need it<i> dark?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Uh.  Combat stuff lets me see in the dark.  Wider spectra, can even see in the infared.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“<i>Ah.</i>” August nervously swallowed still, the minor shock still making her more on edge, her host already visibly relaxing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“I don’t know how you just… recover so quickly.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Getting lost in tunnels isn’t the hardest thing most magical girls do in a normal week.  Besides, I was practically <i>raised </i>in tunnels like these.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Really?  How?  You must’ve been a kid!  And not like, the one you look now!” June sputtered, clearly trying to understand how the girl before them became a magical girl.  August rolled her eyes a little at the showmanship.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P85">“Uh.  My parents worked for D&amp;E.  I contracted as soon as an Incubator showed up.   They got the pamphlet and stuff explaining how it all worked, but they already knew.  Patriotic duty or something.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“D&amp;E?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Delivery and Errands.  Started as a Mitakihara delivery company, then all of Japan, and now they’re mostly a vestige of formality.  Some of the Ancients like to wax poetic and be nostalgic about the old days.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">“Oh.” August said.  “I didn’t know it was formed in Mitakihara.  I think one of the ancestors of our parents was from there.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“August, the sooner you learn this the better.  A <i>lot</i> of stuff out here still has ties back to Mitakihara.” Karina huffed, her shoulders tensing as they found themselves at the door they’d been ushered through the day before, “lightly encouraged” at spearpoint.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“And here we are at the station.” Karina announced, distracted by something the girls couldn’t see as she pushed through the turnstile.  “Just stay on the train until it says something about housing or sanctuary.  Both stops get you to Rehousing.” Karina imparted as she turned towards the stairs. August and June watched as the girl transformed in an instant, acknowledging an alert on her TacComp.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“Next train is in two minutes.  See you later!   You should be able to get in to my place if anything goes wrong!” she yelled jumping back over the turnstile and sprinting up the stairs, so quickly that she left a cloud of dust as she left.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“Wait but I-” August began, Karina already long gone.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“What is it?” June asked, trying to console her sister.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“I wanted to say thank you… and to ask if Galileo was still working in the city center...”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“I thought Galileo was like… a super smart AI.” June piped, relaxing finally that it was her and her big sister again.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“Yeah! They are, but… they were always really nice when I needed help with my math homework.” August professed.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P86">“But… I thought that was something Governance Ar-ith-ma-meti-”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“Arithmatic Education.  Yeah AriEd did help a bunch, but… Galileo didn’t make me feel dumb when I messed up...” she mused, reflecting on memories of her digital confidant.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P87">The two girls found themselves in a small but very functional office nestled between a bombed out office complex and a small coffeeshop that <i>somehow</i> still had beans.  Not many, mind you, but still.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P87">As they approached the front desk, the lady behind it gestured for them to wait a moment, as she hung up an audio call, hand gesture and all.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Hi uh… we’re looking for someone named Stephanie?  Uh… Luhr-sama told us you’d be able to get us a place to live.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Oh, you’re the two kids her patrol found on the train, huh.” she grumbled, her eyes slightly bloodshot as August had a chance to get a closer look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Yep that’s us!” August nervously laughed, hoping the woman would be able to help them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Well, <i>I’m </i>Stephanie.  Stephanie Diaz.  So, I’ll be honest, that puta was a bit misleading.  We don’t have <i>all that many</i> residences with open slots.  There’s three in total that are willing, and all of them are at least four person households.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Uh, does that include folks who are deployed or something?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Ordinarily, yes, but… allegedly MSY and the matriarch are in the middle of peace talks.  They expect her to renege on her vow of destruction.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Wait <i>what</i>?” June exclaimed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Yep.” the lady smiled, “we might finally be able to focus on getting out of this little bubble of ours.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Wait, but...-” August began, Stephanie cutting her off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“That means a lot of the deployed staff are expected to return home.  So, unless <i>Karina-chan </i>decides to let you stay, you’d end up in common housing.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Diaz-sama, <i>please.</i>  Can we just stay with Luhr-sama?  She seemed to like us, I think.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“You think?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“She acted like she had to go do something urgently and like… ran away after transforming.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">Stephanie could help but roll her eyes. “That’s the problem with active duty magical girls, y’know?  Always running off.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Well, we’re not, so we’d be more than happy to provide home-comforts.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Well, there’s at least two things you’d need to do first.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Background check, right!  She said that’d be a thing.” August piped, Stephanie raising a flat palm, trying to get her to slow down.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Yeah.  A MSY enlisted mind-reader will ask you a series of questions to ensure you have no ill intents to get access to anything you shouldn’t.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“I mean… that’s fine.” August nervously responded, June all the more annoyed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Why‽ it’s a house!  We already stayed there last night!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“<i>Oh.</i>” Stephanie scowled.  “She didn’t <i>tell me that</i> when she scheduled your appointment.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Is… that a problem?” August broached cautiously, Stephanie relaxing slightly, and then exhaling dramatically.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“No.  No, it’s fine, she does this sometimes.  Which of you wants to go first?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“I-I’ll do it.” August stuttered, looking back at June and squeezing her hand, June smiling back.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P90">The woman paused for a moment, before shaking her head slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P90"> </p>
<p class="paragraph-P91">“Okay, you first.  C’mon.” the woman waved, before pausing for a moment, as if being told something by an untold voice. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">Right, telepathy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P93">“Nevermind. Your interviews will be concurrent, both of you, follow me.” she said through an incurious affect.  With intentional and nervous movement, August and June disappeared around the corner into a maze of hallways.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P94">The two carefully made their way across the carpeted office, a clear relic of luxury that the complex no longer had, windows boarded with any haphazard flat materials from shattered glass, shards still embedded in the carpet in places.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P94">“What happened here…?” June muttered under her breath as Stephanie huffed.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P95">“What do you <i>think happened</i>,<i> </i><i>Volokhov</i><i>?”</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P94">She didn’t respond, growing weary of adults and their casual cruelty.  As the woman kept walking, August realized she <i>also </i>had a ring on her left hand, same as Karina, same as so many others.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P96">She was a magical girl too.  She just was a whole lot meaner than most.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P97">Stephanie stopped in front of a room labeled “Interview”, the placard well worn, the metallic accents flaking off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P97">“In you go.” she waved, August and June taking a seat in the room at the table.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P97">The lights turned on once they sat down, their <i>interviewer</i> already waiting.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P97">“August and June Kisaki, eh?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">The girls both nodded, the magical girl continuing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“Birthplace?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P98">“Uh… Frieburg Specialized in Nova Sicilia…. Galileo-Mu.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“You don’t need to be that specific.  Also, just say if you don’t know.” the girl chided, both of them nodding nervously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“You were adopted?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“By the Kisakis, yeah.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“<i>Those</i> Kisakis?  The <i>matriarchy</i> of Itsumi Kisaki<i>?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“Kinda. Estranged branch.  They weren’t allowed to adopt kids from the other family members apparently.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P99">The magical girl nodded, her short cut jet black hair waving slightly at the action.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“Have you been in combat before?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“If you count trying to get the hell out of it, sure.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“Have you fired a gun before?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“What happened after the Kisakis adopted you and your sister?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">August paused, overcome with memories of the bubble collapse, and then… and then… gunfire.  Screaming.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P101">The magical girl didn’t need mind-reading to see how much she was struggling, awkwardly mumbling “Let’s change the topic, okay?” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">June was all the more grateful, nodding on her sister’s behalf.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Why does <i>anyone</i> move these days; for a better life.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Hah, fair enough.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Any skills?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“We can cook.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“No, August can cook.  I just act as assistant.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“That it?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Well she can fire a gun and I learn fast.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Favorite colors?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Pink!” chimed June, August, admitting sheepishly that she prefers red.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Oooh, a divergence, interesting!” the girl laughed, both relaxing slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Now, have either of you been eligible for contract?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“We’re the right age but I haven’t seen an Incubator or been contacted.” August said truthfully, June averting her eyes, if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“You do know how it <i>works</i>, just to be sure, right?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“I think so.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">The magical girl relaxed in her chair slightly, a devilish smile on her face.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P100">“All-right then,<i> </i><i>Kisaki</i><i>-chan.  </i>Enlighten me.”</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P100">“Uh so.  A girl about our age, has <i>potential</i>, whatever that is.  If you tell an Incubator your wish, they can make a gem, one that can take the form of a ring, that taps into the your own inherent power, the power of your soul.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P103">She hesitated for a moment, the strands of searches she’d seen before it all went down, Galileo’s musing on <i>soul gems </i>lingering on the edge of her thoughts.  About grief, corruption, wraiths, Incubators and their pursuit to reduce entropy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“Good answer.” the magical girl said coolly, August blissfully ignorant that their interviewer <i>got every piece of it</i><i>.  </i> She fired off a message to Karina mentally, inquiring whether or not she noticed that the girls knew more about soul gems than they let on.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">In what felt like an instant, Karina shot back three characters.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P105">NO‽</p>
<p class="paragraph-P106">The Incubator says the younger one has a lot of potential too, despite the potential for it to go all Aurora on us.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P107">That bad?  Is it even worth the risk then?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P106">Do we have a choice?  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">As the interview continued, the questions grew more and more strange, August getting more and more concerned what they walked into.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Which weighs more, a kilo of feathers or a kilo of metal?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Uh- they’re the sam-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Correct.  What smell do you most closely associate with your mother?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Cinnamon, but-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Would you rather traverse a dark path with a flashlight, or a slippery, well illuminated path?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“I don’t know, uh, the flashlight one?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">After the barrage of questions, their interviewer paused, a voice appearing directly in the minds of the Kisakis without the interviewer moving her mouth.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P109">Do you have a wish prepared?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P109">Yes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P110">With a nod, a small furry creature stepped out of the shadows of the interview room, leaping onto the table with ease, and taking a seat next to the magical girl.  Golden rings suspended around long ears, white fur flowing into pink, and unblinking round eyes staring at them as much as it was<i> through</i> them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P110">“An Incubator!” August balked, June’s expression more despondent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P110">“So it <i>was</i> one of you in that dream…” she confessed, her resolve palpable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P110">“You had a dream involving an Incubator <i>before</i> you contracted?  Huh..."</p>
<p class="paragraph-P109">June Kisaki, what wish will make your soul gem shine?</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P110">August’s voice raised to a shrill tone as she leapt out of her seat, “Don’t! Please!”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P110">June smiled at her sister, overtaken by an implacable sense of serenity.  With a careful gesture, she gave her a hug, trying to make the moment last.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P110">“It’s okay sis.  You’ve protected me since we lost Mom and Dad.  Now, it’s my turn to protect you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P111">The Incubator’s head tilted askew, a mimic of human and animal traits, uncharacteristic and even more horrifying, it chose to respond to her pleas.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P112">Why would you not want this for her, Kisaki-kun?  Her soul shines for this, as does yours.  Your sister has immense ability to reduce net entropy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P113">“Juni, please, don’t do this!  Incubator, please, I’ll do anything, <i>please</i>!  <i>Anything </i>but this!” August balked, tears cascading down her face onto the table as held her sister tight.  June gently withdrew from August’s embrace, standing up and looking at the Incubator expectantly, the telepath interviewer moving to act in an instant.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P113">With a quick nod, August collapsed onto the floor, unconscious and dreaming of a world without wishes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P114">As the room flooded with a brilliant pink light, Stephanie watched through the observation window with glee.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">“A new Kisaki contract, huh…”</p>

<p class="paragraph-P120">August lurched upright in the medical bay bed, an older bearded man already urging her to relax.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P120">“August, it’s okay, you’re safe, just <i>relax.</i>” he cooed, August straining slightly as she collapsed back into bed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“What… what happened?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“You and your sister-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Wait! Where’s June!  Please, tell me that nightm-”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P121">The doctor’s otherwise cordial disposition was replaced by one implacable.  Somewhere between guilt and pity she thought, still dizzy.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Your sister is safe too.  She’s going through training with Karina.” he huffed, August’s face awash with anguish.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P121">“I’m Doctor Craig Riddel, but please, call me Craig.” the bearded man said, trimmed close and kept proper.  An immaculate labcoat, clean shoes, the works.  He practically <i>reeked</i> of a 21st century doctor.  An anachronism in practice, in what <i>felt</i> like a concrete tomb.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Doct-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Doctors orders, don’t call me by that damned title.  Please. I didn’t earn it.” he grumbled, each syllable hung on his tongue more than the last.  In an instant, he was focusing on seemingly anything but her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Craig.” she weakly muttered, his face lit up with joy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Excellent!  Now, August, how are you<i> feeling</i>?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P122">“Like I’ve been run through a meat grinder.” she mumbled, trying to brush away a strand of hair out of her face, staring at the glass windows that revealed only rock.  The blasted sandstone of the subway far above replaced with hastily produced concrete, small bits of gravel still visible if she squinted at the gentle gradient of reds and oranges.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Well, that’s one way to describe<i> </i><i>that</i> combat<i> </i>zone…” he said, voice trailing off as he gave the girl a look of pity.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">After a moment, August couldn’t help but ask the obvious, “Doc-sorry.  <i>Craig.  Do you know w</i>hen can I <i>leave</i>?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“Not for a bit.  You are <i>long since overdue</i> for a checkup.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P121">“You <i>know that stuff​​?”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P123">Craig belly-laughed at her, her embarrassment apparent.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P124">“I’m making an educated guess, honestly.  Very few people have as of late, but you have some more lingering issues.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“What do you ­<i>mean</i>?” August balked, trying to steel herself for needles and agony.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“It looks like the experience of watching your sister contract in conjunction with a, let’s say <i>inelegant </i>telepath knocking you unconscious left you with parts of your brain in a less than ideal state.  I’d normally suggest therapy, but-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“No therapists, huh…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“Oh we have them, they’re just <i>not here.</i>  They’re on the front near <i>Nova Sicilia</i>.  The most direct support group for magical girls there, since the risk is so great.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P125">Risk of despair.  Psychological damage.  Grief.  I’d read about them, about… what some think happens in their afterlife.  A moment frozen in eternity.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P126">Sounds awful.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P127">An awkward silence hung in the air,  the tension only cut by a cleaning robot attending to the hallway outside.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P127">“So… what do I do then?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P127">“My advice?  Talk to your sister.” he advised, pulling out a small applicator from a drawer opposite to her, and applying ointment to her scabs from countless falls on the way to the city.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P127">“<i>How?</i>  She contracted, she’s a <i>magical girl!” </i>she winced, the venom in the words throwing Craig off from perfectly applying the salve.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">I guess she’s got some less than ideal feeling about ‘em.  I can’t blame her too much, but… they’re all we’ve got right now.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“She’s still your sister, August.  And besides… it’s not like you can’t join her.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“I am <i>not</i> contracting!” she spat, Craig’s displeasure palpable.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P128">“You don’t have to <i>right now. </i> We still need more folks who can support <i>them</i> in combat.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“So what, they’re safe and I’m not, and I just get shot by someone else with big-ass bullets?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“Safest place in all of this is either in a bunker like I am, or by the side of magical girls, believe it or not.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“I <i>don’t</i>.  I got my sister here safe, that means <i>something!”</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P129">“Sure does.  It means you can keep others safe.  But you’ve been largely a <i>non-target</i>.  Its been magical girls fighting each <i>other</i>.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P130">The words echoed in August’s mind, each heartbeat driving her more distant from Craig’s assurances.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“And just like that, you’re done.  A little gene therapy, a few nanite upgrades, and the upgraded Emergency Mode.” he prattled off with ease.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“Upgraded <i>how?</i>” August mumbled, still reeling from the dizzying conversation they’d had moments prior.        </p>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“Ehh… hard to say.  It’s an improvement and the number of civilians reporting medical issues <i>did</i> drop.  I’d assume it’s correlated.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">August feigned a laugh, Craig’s demeanor softening again, ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“Don’t they tell you these things, you’re a doctor after all.” she asked, half-hoping he’d take it in good faith.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P132">Through a weary smile, Craig couldn’t help but respond earnestly.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P133">“A doctor, not a mathematician.  Besides, not like Halley has been around to crunch numbers for me.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P134">Halley.  Oh god, Galileo.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“Okay, Doc-Craig.  Sorry, I-” she rushed, words spilling over one another as she bolted out of the bed, struggling to let the bed’s arms lower.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“I-really-need-to-go-and-see” she spewed through shallow breaths, “if-my-friend-Galileo-is-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“Oh <i>no you don’t!” </i>Craig raised, the door shutting as he mentally tripped a lockdown for the room.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“You are <i>not</i> allowed back in the combat zone unless you’re with a magical girl.  That’s MSY’s policy and it’s going to be the one you’re <i>running by.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“Stop-being-so-stupid-why-!?” she yelped, still flailing wildly as the door opened again.  In a moment of panic, she steadied herself, and found herself face to face with Karina Luhr, in full magical girl regalia, spare one difference.  A gun strapped to her thigh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“Because your Emergency TNC Petition was approved.  Welcome to the team, August.” she smiled, her new teammate groaning with anguish.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“What the hell do you <i>mean</i> emergency petition!?  All your girls did were stick stuff at my brain telepathically and let me sleep at your house!” August balked, Karina trying to pass it off as normal.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“And you passed with flying colors!  Most try to stab me with the coatrack in the foyer!” she smiled, August in utter disbelief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“So, because you evidently do fairly well in fighting, despite being otherwise untrained, my boss thought it wise to train you up the way other TNCs have been historically.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“And that means…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Guns, self defense, medical, and a non-zero amount of telepathic resistance training.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Telepathic self-defense…” she mumbled to herself, before her cheeks turned crimson, yelping “What the hell did your telepath see?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“About what we’d expect for someone who tried to stop her sister from contracting…” Karina admitted sheepishly, indifferent to August’s <i>embarrassment</i> in place of fear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“What- you…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P136">Dr. Riddel couldn’t help but interrupt her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P136">“Pardon me for interrupting, First Lieutenant Luhr-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P136">“Craig, I already told you about this, if I can’t call you doctor, <i>you </i>can’t call me First Lieutenant!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P137">“Fine, <i>Karina.  </i>Why <i>lie</i> to her?  TNC Petitions?  Preposterous! Those aren’t a thing!”  he growled, his anger broiling over into disappointment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P138">Karina couldn’t help but shrink a little, and August couldn’t help but grow fonder at the sight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P139">Even Luhr-sama gets nervous, and she’s been doing this for decades.  Maybe it’s not such a bad thing to be afraid.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“Okay so, admittedly, I <i>might’ve</i> lied about the TNC Petition thing.” she shuddered, eyes averted and staring at the polished-to-a-mirror floors.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“What do you mean <i>lied!”</i> August balked, barely containing her dismay.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P140">“Well, TNCs haven’t been a thing since the Unification Wars.  I needed <i>something</i> that sounded right to describe, well… you being allowed to do stuff without being contracted.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P138">August raised her hand for a moment, as if to respond, and found herself struggling to process too many ideas, too many <i>theories</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P138">“Why…?” she mumbled, her face plastered with confusion.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P138">The magical girl conceded, and nodded to Dr. Riddel to release the lockdown, as the door unlatched, Karina only in the moment noticing she’d ripped the lock out of the wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“Hey August, let’s go for a walk.  C’mon.” she gestured, as the two of them exited the patient room, nervously chuckling at Dr. Riddel.  The pair turned towards the arrow on the wall with neat script in Standard saying “Gallery”.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“So… wait.  Why the hell couldn’t you just<i> tell me</i>?” August squawked. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“Because Craig <i>doesn’t</i> need to hear this part.  You’re involved with MSY now because of your sister’s wish.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“Wait, her <i>wish​</i>?  What the hell even <i>is it?”</i> August beckoned, only to be met with Karina shaking her head softly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“Sorry, you should know as well as any family member of a magical girl, it’s on her to share it with you.  Not my place to share it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“But she’s my sister!” August whined, Karina’s face filling with dismay.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P142">“And she’s my second lieutenant.  Apparently.” Karina said, incredulous. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P143">August wanted to be upset with her, absolutely furious.  She couldn’t quite shake the feeling that Karina wasn’t exactly <i>enthusiastic</i> about June contracting though...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“Did you ask for her specifically?  Or was it just <i>dumb luck</i> you got my sister?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“Does it matter?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“It matters <i>to me.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P144">After a silence that felt like an eternity, Karina capitulated, feeling absolutely remiss how <i>easily</i> she swayed her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“She requested it, actually.  I think she figured that between your civilian status and being housed in my family’s home, she’d have the best chance at still being in your life and protecting you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“Protect <i>me</i>?  She’s the one about to leap into danger!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P144">Karina paused for a moment, looking up at the archway protecting the interior dome, “Gallery” written in Standard, glyphs below it shimmering, visible only to Karina.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P144">“What do you know about the cult, August?” Karina asked, her voice vacant as she stared up at the worn sandstone and carved rock.  The faces of magical girls past.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P144">“The <i>cult​?  </i>The Church, you mean.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P144">“True enough.  Different names for the same thing.  The difference historically is <i>belief.</i>” she quipped, August growing more confused by the minute.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P146">Karina’s gaze stayed fixated on the scene before her, a singular girl working on a floral figure to the right, about halfway down the room as she thought at the girl framing the wall with her fingers.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P147">Can you give us some space Andrea?  Doing a little theological chat with a family member.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P146">The girl’s head turned back towards her, her expression frustrated.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P147">But I was in the middle of this!  I really had something going! </p>
<p class="paragraph-P146">Karina couldn’t help but roll her eyes as the magical girl continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P147">If this “Tiro Finale” looks wrong on the setting of Tomoe-san, you can fix it yourself!  Ugh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P147">Sure…. Whatever Andrea. Karina thought absentmindedly, as she realized August was waiting on her to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P144">“It’s… the faith of magical girls, right?” she repeated, her voice meeker as she watched Karina’s attention snap back to her, the figure in the distance descending the scaffolding as if on cue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“Close.  Most refer to Her like that.” August yielded, the girl leaving the room as she finally relaxed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“More than anything, it’s a hope that after this life, that our good deeds and harm don’t cancel each other out, no matter how we leave this life.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P149">“First of all, <i>Her</i>?  Capital “H” and all?” August asked, trying to be careful with her words.  She knew some of this, of course, you always learn reading rumors.  Still, rumors are one thing, but exploration of faith<i> with</i> a magical girl was something else entirely.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P150">Karina didn’t seem to mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P144">“If she’s a Goddess, it’s proper and all, right?” Karina said fondly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P144">“I wouldn’t know.” August nodded, half-heartedly encouraging her to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P144">“Besides, Law of Cycles is a <i>mouthful</i> at times.” Karina giggled, August unable to resist smiling a little.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P151">It sounds nice in a way.  A proper goddess, Hope against Despair?  Wishes are miracles of our own witness, if even some of the stories I’ve read are to be believed.  Maybe it’s not as bad as I’d thought, but it’s not like I can ask someone their experiences with the afterlife.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P144">“Cancel each other out, though?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P152">“That our wishes weren’t made for no reason.  That at the pits of our despair, a Goddess of Hope would save us, that all of it was for <i>something.</i>” she said, her eyes focused on the facsimile of a girl August didn’t recognize, but one that Karina <i>clearly</i> did. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P152"> A girl’s silhouette carved from stone, a fascia recognizable to a select few, but on display so far from her original home, the facsimile of a soul gem on her stomach.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P153">They kept walking, Karina’s heels clattering on the floor as August’s sneakers tread lightly. It was hard for her <i>not</i> to observe some reverence, but she faltered upon seeing the end of the chamber.  It was <i>incomplete.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P154">“Karina… at the end.  That’s…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P154">“That’s her.  Of sorts.  As far as we can tell based on what Akemi-san’s said.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Which one is Akemi-san?” August asked cautiously, eyes darting from<i> </i><i>statue</i> to<i> </i>statue,  motifs of chains and spears yielding to muskets and florals, the motif continuing through others.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P155">August found herself confused by the scaffolding next to faceless woman’s figure at the end of the hall, a serene look as she held the impression of the Earth in her hands.  The scaffolding laid dormant, scarcely used it seemed.  Net meshes had the smallest pieces of debris and dust, something started and not quite finished.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P155">As her eyes were drawn towards the Earth again, as she squinted her eyes slightly, hoping she’d see better through the textile, she made out the slightest hint of a hand reaching up towards the Goddess’ hands, the profile of a star barely visible on a fingernail.  The chalked outline of another by her side, present and absent, all at once.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P156">“The original plans allegedly had her next to her Goddess, but… not this time.” Karina glowered, her gaze drilling into the dark-as-the-night flooring, a motif taken with grace from an atrium of similar purpose on Earth.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P156">“Why <i>not</i>?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P157">Karina paused for a moment, realizing that August almost sounded <i>hurt</i> on her behalf.  As if, despite every reason not to, she still cared about what she had to say.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P157">“Itsumi Kisaki.” Karina winced, half-regretting it as soon as the words left her mouth.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P157">“Kisaki?  What does my <i>family</i> have to do with this?  I’m adopted anyways, not like I’d <i>know </i>any of them!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P158">“You bear their name, so… I’m sure others will assume you bear the burden of responsibility too.” she admitted, August still reeling.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P159">Besides, your sister will inevitably be targeted as a new contractee, bearing your family name...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P158">“The <i>matriarch </i>was very insistent on the “heretical nature” of Akemi Homura’s claims.  Saying that she has <i>no right </i>to claim to be the messenger of the Law of Cycles.” she stated plainly, emphasis on the allegations cast, as if sharing catty gossip.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P160">“Heretical? How can she be <i>heretical</i> when she’s the one who explained it to her fellow magical girls in Mitakihara‽  She’s the one who they made the damned <i>movie</i> about!  She was the <i>First </i><i>damned</i><i> Executive!</i>” August exclaimed, arms waving as she stumbled for a moment, Karina catching her, and brushing off the moment as quickly as she could.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P161">The silence hung in the air as Karina tried to collect herself, August gulping nervously as she realized with horror why she felt so <i>strange</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P162">She had a crush.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P161">“Hey August.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P161">“Yeah?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P161">“Why do you <i>know </i><i>all that</i><i>?” </i>Karina asked, her gaze in shadow still. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P163">“I… think I read it somewhere online.  Not sure.  Maybe the movie about her?” she mumbled, hoping desperately to change the topic as she barreled onwards.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P163">“I thought the movie wasn’t even out yet?” Karina asked cautiously, a raised eyebrow and a funny face cutting the tension better than she might’ve expected otherwise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P163">“It might not be… I learned about her in history lessons though.  And then read the previews.. I mean, who <i>wouldn’t</i>?  She’s <i>awesome!</i>” she gushed, not quite processing that the <i>movie star</i> she was so infatuated with were closer to Karina’s <i>boss </i>than any other term that might fit better<i>.  </i><i>Still, she couldn’t help but giggle at August’s </i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P163">“Still though!  It’s absolutely no fair they try to say it’s <i>heresy.</i>  Why didn’t the Church get upset over it?”</p>

<div class="paragraph-P163">“They did, despite the blowback.  There’s a reason that MSY and the Kisaki matriarchy splintered over it.  Even if you want to argue about this Goddess being <i>“</i><i>religious claptrap</i><i>”</i> as one rumor put it, the existence of Akemi Homura isn’t exactly <i>debatable.</i>  The only debate was after New Athens, about…”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P164">Karina found herself staring up at the dome of the gallery, a night sky painted with such diligence and observation that the human eye might mistake it for the real thing, if it weren’t the night sky of a world millions of kilometers away.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P165">A night sky bursting with weapons-fire over the horizon, blotted out by wings cut from nightmares, victory seized from the jaws of demise…  </p>
<hr> </hr>
<p class="paragraph-P166">Akemi Homura did not expect to wake up in a hospital bed.  She didn’t expect to <i>wake up.</i>  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P167">She had been… <i>some</i><i>place</i><i> else</i>, her head swirling with memories disconnected and amorphous, colors wiped and distorted.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P168">Timeline… This has been Hers for a very long time.  Why am I thinking of timelines?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P169">She rolled out of the hospital bed as if by rote memorization, reaching for glasses on an absent table as though she had a need for the anachronism.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P168">Ah.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P170">As she came to, she inspected her person, making sure nothing was amiss.  It was <i>unusual</i> for her to sleep, given that she hadn’t <i>needed to</i> in nearly three hundred years, but the last thing she checked, of course, was a mirror.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P171">And she found absent the <i>most important thing</i> she’d ever been steward to.  The Ribbon. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P171">The gift wore at all times, the sister strand to the one in Mitakihara in the chamber of the same origination.  The one she’d so cautiously been guarding since her <i>wish</i>.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P172">Madoka, I’m so sorry.  I’ll get back to you. I promise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P173">As she instinctually attempted to summon her wings, she found herself lacking them, as she glanced down to find a shield on her wrist, gasping in disbelief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P174">How...</p>
<hr> </hr>
<p class="paragraph-P175">Karina still wanted so desperately to know her sister’s wish, and she might be on the team, but she wasn’t <i>one of the girls.</i>  She didn’t want to be, not after the <i>nightmare</i> they’d had to endure to get to this city.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P176">But it might be her best chance of protecting her sister, despite her protests.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“So… do you still want me to contract?” August asked Karina awkwardly, as they arrived back at the hospital room, Dr. Riddel still waiting for her, waving cheerfully through the glass as Karina held the bridge of her nose.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Sorry, just let me-” she started, reaching inside the room and setting the windows to “privacy” as Craig vanished behind an opaque off-white film suspended between the panes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“He’s all too happy to chat, <i>all the time</i>.  It eats me alive…” Karina grumbled.  “Sorry, you were saying?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“I said… do you still want me to contract?  I <i>don’t</i> want to, and I don’t think the wish I had ready really <i>works</i> anymore if she contracted…” August admitted gloomily.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P177">“But if <i>you</i> think I should, I’ll do it.” she said, a confidence in her voice Karina admired, but couldn’t <i>quite </i>bring herself to encourage.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P177">“August Kisaki, don’t you dare contract for anyone but <i>yourself.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P177">“But I want to help oth-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P177">“August!  We <i>all help others.</i>  We’re all dependent on one another, that’s what <i>humanity is.”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">August was taken aback, the outburst crushing her ever visibly, body racked with anguish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P179">“Come up with a good wish.  One that you <i>really believe in.</i>  One that isn’t about some <i>silly crush</i>, or your sister.  One that’s big enough to fit your whole heart into.”  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P180">Karina felt absurd being so <i>pointed about it</i>, but it was clear that August’s crush wasn’t going to go away unless she did <i>something</i> about it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P181">The last thing I need is the only potential contractee the Incubators have supervised to succumb to despair and vanish as soon as they contract.  Shannon would never forgive me if she did, wherever she is...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“Not my soul?” she inquired, her head askew slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“Your soul is in the gem.  Your heart, is what goes in the wish.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“Never heard that before.” August mumbled, Karina sheepishly scratching her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“Neither have I, I just made it up.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“I hope you’re better at mission execution than you are at poetry Karina, or else you’re going to get shot…” Craig muttered from the door-frame.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“A mission?  I’ll be right up then.” she smiled, “August, talk to Craig about getting some <i>actual food</i>.  When was the last time you ate, at my house?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“Shit.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“I <i>thought so.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“At least the bread was good…” she grumbled, Karina’s face awash in joy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">“It really was.  Next time, I’m asking for a cake!”</p>

<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Their eggs make me queasy…”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Okay, I’ve got bread still, stuff made by a lovely Barrier Generator named Seika, and…” Craig began, picking up a glass jar of jam from the fridge and squinting at the label.</div>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Looks like one that Karina-san had at her home…” August mumbled absentmindedly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">“It’s… apparently orange and elderflower preserves.  The label says “Lullaby” though, in… Swedish, I think?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">“Why <i>do</i> the Luhrs have such… interest in language?  The sign on their door was in more than one language too.” August awkwardly stumbled out, Craig pulling over the stool at the table opposite to her in the kitchenette.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">“Well… I think it was mostly Shannon’s doing, frankly.  She was worldly, a venerable historian in training.  For a while she had aspirations of studying under Clarisse van Rossum, like Julian Bradshaw got the chance to when he started out.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">“Did she get to?” August asked, her ears perked at the mentions of people so <i>well known</i>, even this far out.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">“Hm... I don’t <i>think</i> so.  The Contact War put a bit of a damper on most people’s plans though…” Dr. Riddel grumbled, dismissing the discontent as easily as it’d arrived.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">“So she knows Swedish when <i>in a jam</i>, Japanese by marriage, English by convention.  What’s next, <i>French?”</i> August balked, Craig bursting into laughter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">“Goddess I hope not!” he hollered, August’s cackling tamped only by her sudden realization.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P183">He said Goddess too.  What the frick?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P183">“Hey Doc-I… Craig?” she asked cautiously, Dr. Riddel’s hand turning; a gesture to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P184">“Why do<i> you</i> believe in that Goddess the magical girls do?  Not like we’d get to see their heaven or anything.” August mumbled, relishing the texture of the berries.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P184">“Do you mind if I-” Riddel asked, August nodding as he quickly scarfed down some more bread, jam, and cheese.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P184">Coughing to clear his throat as he poured himself a glass of something called “rangpur lumiade” the color of strawberry milk, and fairly tart, coughing through the acidity as August couldn’t help but snort.  As his esophagus stopped betraying him so dearly, he explained.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P184">“August my dear, I’m a middle-aged man, nearly one-hundred and twenty.  I will <i>eventually</i> see my own mortality, whether by fighting in here, or cephalapod out <i>there</i>.<i>  </i><i>I may have survived mandatory service, barely, but that doesn’t mean death doesn’t happen.  </i>Given that<i>,</i> I want to believe in <i>something</i>, and frankly, magical girls seem to be privy to the miracles of our time.  I see no reason to not believe in<i> one more.”</i></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P184">August took a moment to chew on her words as well as the bread, the aroma of the orange cutting through the elderflower, a proverbial summer spread in something that’d be right at home on a 21st century Earth.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P185">I see no reason to not believe in one more miracle.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P184">“I guess that’s fair… thank you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P184">“No, thank you for asking!  Most just assume I’m some tragic old man lamenting a lost girlfriend.” he laughed, August raising an eyebrow cautiously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P184">“Oh no, no, don’t you start!” he laughed, August giggling at his antics.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P184">“Now.  We’ve gotten a snack, what do you say about <i>some actual food</i>.” he exclaimed, his enthusiasm contagious as August burst into cheer.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P186">As he strode across the kitchenette, Craig tapped open a door hand-labeled “SECRET” as out popped his <i>real food</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">August was <i>incredibly</i> disappointed that “real food” constituted ration bars.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“So you eat this…stuff... <i>all the time?”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“Excuse me, miss August.  Weren’t <i>you </i>more-or-less scavenging for a few months?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“Most homes here had better food than something that feels like tree bark…” she grumbled, half-way through a bite that erupted with a cacophonous shattering sound.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P188">Riddel grimaced through his last bite cautiously, as if not to let her get in a word in edgewise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P189">“I’d rather spend my time treating patients than cooking… I’ve got to get back to one soon anyways.” he mumbled, checking his chronometer.  August took a few extra ration bars, shoving them into her bag quickly, taking the chance to refill her water bottle.  Craig absentmindedly chewed his ration bar before dry-swallowing, coughing twice, and then hoarsely finished the thought.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P187">“She’s a bit of a special case, seeing as how she was… well.  Nevermind.  She’s likely to wake up soon.” </div>
<p class="paragraph-P190"> </p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“So, Craig kicked you out of the little kitchen, huh?” Karina laughed weakly, the door behind her ajar slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“We got toast and some really odd lemonade!” August mumbled, her voice mired with exhaustion.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“Oh the lumiade?  He loves to give that stuff to new folks to see how much they hate it.” Karina smiled, August indifferent to the attempted hazing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“He had most of it, to be honest.” she shrugged, Karina </p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“Wait, really?  That <i>jerk!  </i>Thank you, I’m gonna beat him up over this later.” she winked at August, smiling fondly, still clearly enjoying the idea of being <i>friendly</i> with her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P192">“So… uh…” Karina chattered, “we’re gonna probably take June on a training mission today.  So, as much as I’d love for you to come along… I don’t think you can go.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P192">“What!?  But Craig said I can go out with a magical girl! And you said I was <i>on the team!</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P192">“I… not like that though.  Besides, it’s <i>training!</i>  Your training and hers are going to be different by necessity.  Last thing I’d want is to run into a demon spawn and you to get hurt.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“And what does <i>June</i> say about that?” August balked, trying to keep her cool.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“I didn’t ask her.  It’s not <i>up to her. Or me</i>, for that matter.<i>”</i>Karina admitted, August’s posture collapsing with defeat, as her body hung heavy in the corridor.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">With her head still hung by the weight of reality, she mumbled in response, defeated.  “Okay…. Is there anything I can do at your house then?  I <i>really </i>don’t wanna go to the gallery again.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Wait, why not?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Going by myself feels… odd?  I don’t know.  It’s not my faith, y’know?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P194">Karina raised her hand as if to argue, glancing at her own hand and caught her soul gem, in ring form, glimmering slightly as she thought better of it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P195">I’ve got a heart, but I’ve got to have a soul too.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">“Well, if you want to, there’s a library in the house you can thumb through.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">“Wait, like… paper and book?  Like the cookbook?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">“I know real paper books are something of an oddity, but Shannon really did like to keep paper copies.  A lot of it was migrated from Earth or other Core Worlds by her family.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">“Think she’s got anything on magical girls contracting?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P197">“So you don’t lose your mind over your sister?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P198">She nodded, her demeanor already improving by the minute.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P199">“I think it was Parenting Plexus Online…” she mumbled, pausing.  “Well, I guess this is offline?  But, besides the point I guess.  There should be some stuff on getting through it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P200">August couldn’t help but soften at the thought.  Despite how angry she was, Karina genuinely seemed to want to help.  Even if there were rules, even if she was just the messenger.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P199">“Sisterhood By Sisterhood is the chapter you want.” Karina continued, August gingerly raising her hand.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Hey… Karina?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Yeah?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Why did you know that offhandedly?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">Karina grimaced slightly, before putting on a pleasant smile.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P201">“Let’s just say you’re not the first girl to have her sister contract.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P201">August got up and dusted her jumper off before pausing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“Wait, can I get a key to the tunnels?  I want to be able to get through with June on the off-chance you’re busy.” she asked, half-expecting an outright rejection.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“After training, yes.  Ophelia would rip my head off if she found out I gave you a key without any of the rules or expectations.” Karina said plainly, finishing on a smile that betrayed the risk.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P203">I can’t just let her go down there unescorted.  Some things do go bump in the night, and we don’t know what they are yet.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“Ugh, <i>fine.</i>” she grumbled, hoping Karina renege on her choice, to no avail.  Then again, <i>June </i>might have more success.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“I gotta go to a meeting, can you head down towards the practice room?  Your sister should be there sparring with Jenna Weaver.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“Oh!  Okay!” August beamed, practically sprinting before she skidded on the floor, and ran back.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“Wait, where <i>is </i>the practice room?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“Follow the signs?” Karina replied, pointing at the signs in Standard gingerly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“Thank you…” August nervously laughed, before walking quickly the way she’d run the first time.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P204">That girl really does love her sister a lot. </p>
<hr> </hr>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“What the hell do you <i>mean</i> espionage?” Karina exclaimed, her line-supervisor rolling her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“It’s exactly what it sounds like.  In, take some information, out.  Or do you not feel like working with <i>her</i> again?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P206">“It’s not that I don’t want to work with her, because I <i>don’t</i>, it’s that she’s a fucking Kisaki!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P206">“Excuse me Karina, but didn’t<i> you</i> just adopt two Kisakis?  Bit of a hypocrite aren’t you?” she insinuated, Karina’s face turning a brilliant red.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P206"><i>“</i><i>Ugh,</i> Stephanie is <i>not</i> the good kind!  The kids are.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P205">“Uh… since when was she a<i> Kisaki</i>?” Lt. Shion balked.  “I didn’t remember <i>her</i> on the family tree, and I <i>think </i>I’d remember.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“She married in but <i>insisted on keeping </i><i>her</i><i> name.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“Was that recently?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P205">“Yeah!  Like, this year!  To <i>spite me!”</i><i> </i>Karina grumbled, already quickly correcting the file on their local share, a pale imitation of the systems she’d had access to when Governance wasn’t so fragmented.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“Well, then you’ll need a barrier generator, to get you through on foot…” Ophelia raised, as the realization dawned on her face.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P207">Grabbing Dr. Riddel’s collar, the man dropped from frozen time with a lurch as he yelped, Homura staring at him with her characteristic neutral demeanor, speaking in the hollow tone her friends heard after New Athens.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P207">“Where did you put it?  One chance.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P208">“WHAT-” Craig screamed, struggling against her grip as she dropped him, Riddel freezing mid-descent as she went back to the hospital room, then returning and dragging him with her, feet on the floor as she strode effortlessly into the room.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P207">“Where. Is. My. Ribbon.” she said, anger percolating to the surface with each word as Craig pointed shakily at a dresser in the opposite corner.  Homura released his collar promptly, Riddel suspended mid-air and mid-scream.  Homura ran her fingers through her hair; a trademark of her depiction worn thin by repetition.  She opened the dresser, and found in a sealed container, MSY issue for charmed or magical items, <i>her </i>ribbon.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P209">She broke the seal on the casing with ease, and gingerly tied the ribbon back around her head, walking towards the clearly marked exits.</p>

<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Cassandra Harakka.” the Incubator spoke into her mind, its face unmoving, lips held in perpetual smile.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P210">She hated it more than anything alive, spare the Cephalapods.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Incubator.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Cassandra, <i>r</i><i>umors</i> that you’re responsible for the reduction in demon spawns have reached my kind.  As a valuable contractee, we hope you’ll be able to tell us the true nature of these rumors.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Maybe, Incubator.  Maybe I have interfered.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Based on prior interaction, it seemed evident to us that magical girls understood the underlying goal, the requisite outcome of demon harvesting.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P211">Cassandra rolled her eyes, the worn wooden chair carrying her frame, her frilly costume still at odds with her demeanor, the gray and black motifs barely visible in the room’s gloomy atmosphere, spare a lamp on the coffee table next to her.  The round bed in the center of the room over her shoulder draped with curtains, glittery stars embroidered into the textile.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P212">“Then why don’t you <i>enlighten me</i> if I’ve missed the mark so clearly?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P213">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P214">The Incubator jumped onto the coffee table with ease, barely registering as its paws softly thudded into the well loved surface, end grain imported from yet another distant world.  Expensive, ornate, and not as <i>efficient</i> as the Incubators would approve of.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P213">“Cassandra, this universe <i>will</i> collapse from heat death if demons aren’t harvested for grief cubes.  Grief cubes are fundamental to the cycle of energy that sustains your species.  Since you made your wish, they’ve become instrumental to the survival of this small universe.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P215">“I know.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P216">“If you don’t allow demon spawns, everyone in this universe, human, magical girl, incubator, will die.  This universe would enter an irreparable high-entropy state, ending reality as you know it.  Surely you understand this.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P216">“I do.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P215">“Why contract only to invalidate your own wish then?  Why hold the universe you formed <i>hostage</i>?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P217">She felt herself grow angrier, the Incubator perpetually able to get under her skin, despite her best efforts.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P218">“Because you Incubators needed incentive to <i>behave.” </i>she grimaced, her jaw clenched with frustration.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P219"><i>“</i>You contract who I tell you, and when.  No one else.  My wish, my rules, my universe.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P220">“You’re behaving irrationally.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P221">“Yeah well, humans are like that.  Didn’t another Incubator say it’s inherent to emotions?” she mumbled, collapsing into the wooden chair again, the armrests worn from her gripping of the ends.  Weeks prior, she didn’t have to worry about her grip shattering the heirloom, but her newfound strength had presented unexpected frustrations.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P222">“Cassandra, my species considers individual emotions to be a mental illness.  Incompatible with our very existence.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P222">“So you’ve said.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P223">“And yet, a part of my conscious self can’t ignore the presence of fear.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P223">“Fear?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P223">“As the resident expert, would you describe fear as an emotion?  Or is it best viewed as a physiological primitive in the context of experience?” the Incubator frowned.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P223">“After all, we lack a prior context window to describe the outcome of your wish as anything but <i>unprecedented.”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P224">She kept her face level, attempting to avoid its observation of her reaction.  Sheer and absolute fear.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P225">Fear?  Incubators can feel fear?  Even if I did let demons spawn and wasn’t trying to defeat them or hide them... Incubators aren’t exactly neutral parties.  They want the work we do.  That’s the price for our wish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P225">But if they don’t need human emotion...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P226">She refused to speak, and the Incubator continued, unprompted.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P227">“There will be a point when if we can’t contract who we need to, this universe’s demise will be inevitable.  Is that <i>really</i> what you want?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P228">Cassandra gripped her left hand in her right, covering her soul gem as she felt herself grow uncomfortable, using the discomfort to steel herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P228">She hoped the bluff worked.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P227">“It isn’t what I want, but you <i>need</i> to follow my rules.  If you don’t… one of the moons can hold all the grief cubes instead.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P229">The Incubator turned its head askew, visibly confused.  It was a mannerism she’d seen it practice too many times to believe it genuine before now, spare the inexplicable show of emotions.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P227">“We never <i>will </i>understand your species, will we?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P230">After a sigh, she banished the Incubator, as it vanished with a snap, air rushing in to fill the space it had just occupied.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P230">“No.  No you never will.  I’ll make sure of it.”</p>

<p class="paragraph-P231">August descending into the basement nervously, the concrete getting more worn with each step underfoot.  While the doctor’s office had been windows revealing concrete, the lower level spared no such dignity; it was concrete worn down to reinforced alloys in places.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P232">She gingerly pushed the door to the practice room, and found herself in an open room roughly the size of a tennis court, the floors smearing into walls with gentle curves smoothing over the edges.  A tall ceiling revealed mirrors into what must’ve been observation rooms, as August realized in the center of the room was her sister, fighting a magical girl clad in yellow.</div>

<div class="paragraph-P233">Her sister was dodging the glancing attacks of the magical girl with ease, her aggressor lunging repeatedly.  The yellow-clad magical girl, Jenna Weaver, August presumed, swung her broadsword with malice.  Each failed strike was followed by her immediately yanking it out of the concrete floor.  Each time debris fell off of the magical blade, her head pivoting frantically as she tried to keep eyes on June.  Her sister wasn’t even using her <i>arms</i> yet.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P234">June’s pink and purple sweater had been replaced with a lacy white and pink dress, the subtle theme of petals forming on the edge of the trim, flowing over a petticoat.  Her simple sneakers replaced underfoot with ornate and functional heels, barely an inch off the ground but distinctly color-matched to her dress.   The pink bow she’d had in her hair for what felt like years had been made a white, but her hair was where the biggest change was.  The muted brown locks she shared with her sister had turned into a radiant pink, held in the now-white bow in a high ponytail. Finally, a stone, her <i>soul gem</i>, a faceted triangle was suspended on her sternum, lined with a thin gold accent.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P233">A scared look flashed on June’s face if for a moment, replaced quickly with determination as she began running towards the wall of the room as Jenna barreled after her, throwing smaller blades at her as she dodged them nimbly.  June didn’t quite escape unscathed though, getting the narrowest approximation of a haircut as a straight-bladed knife sailed over shoulder, slightly to the left of her ears as a few strands of pink hair fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P233">As she reached the wall, she heard Jenna yell as she lunged forward, June jumping up the wall and running <i>up</i> the embankment and vertically against the surface, Jenna’s broadsword firmly burying itself in the wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P233">Jenna surrendered as her weapon dissolved, and her magical girl regalia turned back into a loose tee and a tennis skirt.  Clapping, impressed, she retreated as June landed near the far edge of the room, feigning a bow.  In an instant, she noticed her sister watching the encounter starry-eyed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“August!  Oh gosh I missed you so much!” she gleefully bellowed as she transformed back into her less <i>period</i> attire, sprinting across the room fast enough to cause a breeze behind her.  As she leapt into a bear hug, August yelped, the girl releasing her just as quickly as she’d hugged her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“Ow…” she mumbled, August wincing as she spoke.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P236">Right.  I’m stronger now, this is going to take getting used to...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“Can we talk about-” August began, pointing at her sister’s hair, mousy brown roots taking hold in place of her sister’s chocolate-tone hair.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">June shook her head gently.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“Can we talk about it later? I know you have questions, but I think a lot of them are gonna be answered when Karina gets here.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">August couldn’t help but surrender in the moment.  June usually <i>did</i> get her way, despite her best efforts.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“I think you should sit down on the bench or something.  Minimizes the risk of you getting hurt.” her sister declared factually, August perturbed at her sister’s insights being so obvious when she’d been so reticent to share them before.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“Hm… okay…” August mumbled, brushing dust off of the bench before sitting down gingerly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P237">I’d think most spectators go to the observation room, further from the action.  It’s probably just basic stuff for now, given that I’m still here. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P238">June stood awkwardly in the middle of the room as she waited for Karina to enter, Jenna walking into the locker room after her small encounter with June.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P238">As she idly looked around at the room, June found herself quickly drawn to the sound of glass breaking. Karina yelled as she crashed through the observation room window towards her, June instinctually transforming as she registered that Karina’s spear was aimed <i>right at her </i>and approaching quickly.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P239">She fixed her footing to brace herself quickly, eyes determined as she summoned a glowing pink disc of light.  Karina collided with the barrier, glass shards moments behind her as they both hit the barrier in an instant.  Her spear had shattered against it, the spearhead and staff going in opposite directions, as the glass hung half-suspended in the barrier, Karina’s heel embedded in the glowing shield the same way.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P239">Karina stared at June for a moment, her face showing determination more than anything else, a look she didn’t expect on a <i>rookie.</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P240">She took to this quick.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P241">As the thought registered, June shifted the barrier and Karina slid off, falling onto her back.  As Karina collected herself off the ground, knocking dust off of her dress as her spear, still laying wayward, vanished into a pile of sparkles.  June dropped the barrier, the jagged shards of glass clattering onto the concrete floor, both girls unharmed but one feeling immensely undignified.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P242">Karina’s stance shifted, June summoning two more glowing discs, roughly over her palms as she took blow after blow from her mentor.  Each punch, each kick, met as quickly as she threw them as she shrugged each blow off.  The glowing discs seemed to absorb each impact, slowing her attacker down.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P242">Karina backed away from June, realization dawning on her face that she<i> had</i> to change strategies as she re-materialized her weapon of choice behind her.  Dozens of javelins floated mid-air, June’s eyes following her <i>opponent’</i><i>s </i>actions carefully.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P243">Karina’s gaze remained locked on June as she summoned even more spears, their orbit whipped to a fervor as one by one they lurched at her.  June shattered the the tips with ease, splitting the next barrage cleanly with the edge of a disc as easily as if she were chopping vegetables.  As the storm of sharps finally thinned out, she took the chance to leap vertically from the center of the room, rebounding off of a platform she summoned, aimed back <i>at Karina</i> and hit her mentor square in the shoulder with a glowing sphere around her fist. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">A psychic boxing glove.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P243">Her sister watched, jaw agape as Karina tapped out, June’s barriers dropping instantly, taking the chance to stretch and relax.  She hadn’t expected to fight Karina <i>right after</i> she’d fought Lt. Weaver.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“So you’re a barrier generator.” Karina sighed, June nodding expectantly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P245">“Yeah.  You <i>knew that!” </i>she exclaimed, sulking to herself as Karina stretched more.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P246">She followed through and tried to kill me with her spear!  So much for the joke! </p>
<p class="paragraph-P247">“Yeah well, I needed to make sure you knew how to use it since you didn’t even try against Jenna.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“I didn’t <i>need to!</i>”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P235">The two of them paused for a moment as they noticed August sobbing quietly on the bench, both walking over to her gingerly. Karina un-transformed into a pair of slacks and a sleeveless sweater, her hair in a clip as she sat down next to August.  June failed to transform back, forgetting her attire as she held her sister close, her sister’s snot-nosed sniffling overwhelmed by the scent of summer radiating off of her sister’s floral attire.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“Junebug, you… you’re so-so-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">“I know sis… I know.  Dad would have <i>hated it.”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">August laughed through the tears, wiping her eyes on the sweater.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P248">“Ugh, sorry Luhr-sama.” she offered, Karina attempting to disarm the situation.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P249">“Don’t worry, I have like twenty of those sweaters.  Shannon wore the same thing every day basically.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P250">June gave her a confusing look, absentmindedly thinking “<i>What the hell?” </i>to herself as Karina responded mentally.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P251"><i>Listen, she like</i><i>d</i><i> regularity.</i> </p>
<p class="paragraph-P251">June jumped slightly, realizing she’d just <i>telepathically</i> talked to the other girl.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P252">Get used to it, it happens a lot more than you’d think.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P253">Ugh.  Fine.  Still less bad than when the Incubator did it… that just made my skin crawl.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P254"><i>Me too June, me too</i>.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<p class="paragraph-P247">“Your sister fights dirty August, did you teach her all that?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P255">“As if…” she mumbled, trying to not think about the last twenty four hours.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P255">“We both learned to fight after the world got cut off… People got desperate.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P256">August just nodded a bit, staring at the ring on her sister’s hand, her costume dissolving as she was back the duochromatic sweater August caught only a glimpse of between her sparring with Jenna and Karina.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P257">“Your soul gem…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P257">“I need some grief cubes but I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P257">“You put up <i>way more</i> of a fight than I expected though, what the hell?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P257">“I’m a shield, remember?  Most people just can’t form a shield inside of other matter, or push and pull it like it’s a tablecloth.” she laughed, August realizing something with dread.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">Her sister was <i>happier.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">Karina noticed the look on August’s face, and shrunk slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">“I think you two have a lot to talk about.  I didn’t expect the sparring to go as <i>quickly</i> as little miss menace made it, so… you’ve got a little more time to chat.” Karina admitted before recusing herself, leaving August and June alone for the first time since the train.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">“So… I guess it’s time to talk about it.” June mumbled, her demeanor the same melancholia that August had grown to know so well.  She sat on the bench next to her sister, trying to hold her sister’s hand as she pulled it back.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">“I… I really didn’t want you to contract Junie.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">“I know, I know, <i>I know.</i>” she muttered, holding her head in her hands.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">“You clearly didn’t!” August yelled, June shrinking slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P259">“You made a wish and sold your soul to that little rat-devil!” she yelled, June unable to help smiling a little bit.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P259">“Okay that’s fair actually, but-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P259">“We’re trapped in this tiny reality bubble, and you went ahead and<i> sacrificed yourself</i> for some stupid fight!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P260">“It’s not stupid!  The Ceph are a real threat!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P259">“We haven’t <i>seen</i> any Ceph in here, have we?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P259">“I… no.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P261">“Then what are you<i> fighting? </i> What the hell was your reason to make a damned wish?  What even was it!?” she sobbed, each word more difficult to choke out than the last.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P260">“You.  I contracted for you.” June muttered under her breath, so quiet she was pretty sure August couldn’t hear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">She heard.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“Why.” she muttered, holding her sister’s hand, so gingerly she could barely feel her touch.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“You protected me for so long August… I didn’t want to depend on you forever.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“I would have stayed forever.” August admitted, her voice a whisper.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“How is that fair to you?” June responded, tears welling in her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“Besides… that’s only half of it, if I’m being honest.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“Half.  What’s the other half?  I hope it’s a lot more justified.” August snorted, trying to keep herself together, at the <i>absurdity</i> of what was so <i>clearly</i> a done deal.  Incubators didn’t exactly renege on contracts.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“I… I needed to protect you. From others.  You’re <i>too kind</i>.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P262">“I don’t need your <i>protection! </i>How does that even make <i>sense?</i>  When people were shitty, I protected you.   When the Kisaki family tried to go after Mom and Dad, <i>I </i>hauled your butt out of that burning building!” August fumed, June’s expression unparsable and distant.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“And when Seika taunted you for months on end, do you know why it stopped?” she said, her affect flat and controlled.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“Because she got tired of me?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“Because I <i>made her</i>, August.  It was me, a golf club, and an after-school club meeting.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">“You couldn’t-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P263">“I didn’t hurt her physically, but I got the point across.” June said plainly, eyes, ordinarily mirthful, the brilliant pink catching the light of the room, looking at anything but her sister. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P264">August stared at her in disbelief, struggling to grasp just <i>how much </i>she had been shielded from.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P264">“You may have been my shield, but I was yours too.  You just didn’t know.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P265">August jaw was agape as her sister got up, her soul gem cloudier than it had been at the start of the conversation.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P265">“I’m a barrier generator because my wish was to protect you.  As long as I’m still standing and able to fight, I fight to keep you safe.  Remember that.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P266">August said nothing, <i>could say nothing</i>.  How could she respond?</div>
<p class="paragraph-P265">“I’ll be back after my mission.  Don’t go dying until I get back, okay?” she smiled, August looking up at her, her face despondent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P265">“Same to you, Junebug.” she muttered through a feigned smile, her joy dropping off as soon as her sister turned the corner.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">〈<i>Adrenaline levels beyond threshold〉</i>a mechanical voice prompted in her head. 〈<i>Activate Emergency Mode?</i>〉 </p>
<p class="paragraph-P265">“No.  Fuck you, no.  I’m going to feel my feelings.  I can be miserable if I want!” she mumbled to the empty practice room, the concrete bench under her feeling colder.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P270">Andrea was uncomfortable visiting her mother.  She was uncomfortable how little she remembered after each visit, but she didn’t have a choice.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P270">She took a deep breath, and unlocked the door to her bedroom, stepping in quickly, and locking it behind her.  Her sapphire-colored eyes glimmering slightly in the dim lighting of the room, a voice called to her from a bed in the center, canopy obscuring the figure within.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“Andrea, is that you?” the voice beckoned, as Stephanie took careful steps forward, her heels quiet on the low pile carpet.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“Yeah Mom, it’s me.” she smiled, the figure in the bed methodically turning to face her, each move deliberate as Stephanie felt her sense of self, her memory, stripped further and further back.  As the woman on the bed parted the mesh, Stephanie was turned into a facsimile of her younger self, memories discordant sparing the intruding thoughts that sent her calling to her mother, the <i>incomprehensibility</i> of the family tree.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">With empty, deep-set eyes the color of sea-glass, Itsumi Kisaki looked at her daughter, and through her.  Andrea found her mother’s eyes vacant, disconcertingly so.  She had been this way for months, years even, but it’d felt like an eternity.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">Her thoughts and memories were barely coherent, the future and past strewn about in a massive tangle of memories, even to her own daughter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“I had that dream again.  Of a little world suspended by a thread.” Itsumi mumbled, her hands spinning mid-air as if reeling the earth closer to the canopy’s peak.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“I know Mom, it’s a beautiful dream.” Andrea cooed, her soul gem on her hand growing darker by the moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“And the girl… Cassandra…” Itsumi muttered, looking up at her daughter as Andrea held her mother’s head close.  Andrea took a deep breath, tears hitting her mother’s blue-gray locks, still frizzy and tangled.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“Cassandra will be fine Mom, she’s a strong girl.” Andrea said softly, her mother’s face wracked with anguish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“I don’t think so sweetie...  I keep seeing gunfire.  Explosions, nightmares.  White serpents with golden rings, and so, so much pain.” she mumbled, each word dragging her closer to what Andrea felt was fear, her own mind clouding more by the moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P272">Focus on the reason you’re here.  Focus on June and August.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P273">Andrea yielded, her mother looking at her with weary eyes still, as she sat down on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P273">“Hey Mom… Stephanie found two more members of the family.” she said plainly, unable to meet her mother’s eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P273">“Oh?” Itsumi beamed, more mentally present if for a moment.  “Who are they, tell me more!  Did your brother finally remarry?” she probed, each with more intensity than the last.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P273">“August and June.  They were adopted into the family, but one just contracted, a powerful magical girl.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P273">“Another magical girl!  Finally someone to give you a run for your money, eh?” the matriarch prodded, Andrea’s smile pacifying, knowing that her younger sister already showing her up plenty in the years prior.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P274">So she doesn’t remember Mae… Marion… even Madison!  Good Goddess, her state is getting worse…</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P275">Andrea couldn’t help but notice the decomposing bodies of Marion and Madison on the far side of the bed, soul gems shattered.  The stench of the corpses was <i>nauseating</i>, but she ignored it as best she could.  She <i>had to.</i></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P273">“I hope not…” Andrea muttered under her breath, the facade of authority waning.  Much of Andrea’s own mind was inaccessible or <i>incomprehensible </i>in that moment, proximity to her mother’s damaged psyche overwhelming her own.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P273">“Well, no matter what, just don’t trust what Akemi-san has to say about those girls.  That girl is <i>wretched</i>.  A liar, a thief.  Stole her from all of us.” she muttered, eyes rolling back in her head as she fell into her mountain of pillows.  Andrea couldn’t help but hold her hand in hers for a moment before getting up.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P276">As Andrea hummed a melody under her breath, she opened the nightstand and enveloped her mother’s soul gem, sitting on the surface, in a small pile of fresh grief cubes.  She pocketed the most full in the pocket of her dress, holding two more to her own soul gem.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P273">“I know Mom, I know… I’ll protect you.  I always will…” she whispered, her eyes hopeful.  She <i>had</i> to have faith.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P276">Her mother was distant, already beginning to drift in her dream-state as Itsumi’s terrors overwhelmed her daughter’s mind.  Andrea recoiled as the thought overwhelmed her, wishing she could scream as she felt her throat tighten.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P277">Help me, Shannon, please!  Help me!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P278">Her daughter lurched towards the door as she fell onto the carpet, writhing in agony.  With jagged, agonizing motions, Andrea escaped the radius of her mother’s suffering, overwhelmed as parts of her psyche relented, years of experiences flooding back in a gasp.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“Don’t… do it… Cassandra…” Itsumi mumbled, her voice barely audible as her daughter picked herself off the ground.  If Andrea was concerned over her own inexplicable collapse, she didn’t seem to act on it.  The agony gone as quickly as it’d arrived, as with the memories carried on the suffering.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P276">With wincing steps, she walked over to the nightstand and carefully wound a music box.  Admiring the gentle chimes for a moment, she paused, then headed for the door.  At the threshold, she couldn’t help but glance back at her resting mother.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P277">I hope we find someone to help you soon.  I can’t bear to put you out of your misery.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">She exited the room to find a bearded fellow, a spitting anachronism of a 21st century doctor, staring back at her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Craig.” she said firmly, the man’s emotions indomitable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Andrea.” he grunted half-heartedly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Any changes I missed?” she said, Craig’s demeanor carrying a disconnected calm that, at times, made her want to scream.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Not really, no.  She’s effectively on house-arrest, same as always… and I don’t normally do house calls.” he said, his voice souring.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P281">“And… she’s still going off about her nightmares?” Andrea meekly pressed as he nodded solemnly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Any nurse we send in that survived had the same persistent <i>dream</i>.  The one that got us into this universe, I’d reckon.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“It’s times like these I wish my mother wasn’t a telepath…” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">Craig nodded knowingly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Unfortunately… we both know that’s not how it works.  Older magical girls developing related powers is to be expected past a certain age...”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“And no one else can help her?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“She just swore off the only magical girl who could help.  The only one that’s even remotely possible, if history is any indication.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P282">Andrea’s face lit up, utter astonishment catching her off guard.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P283">“History” she began, her mind recalled to New Athens in an instant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P283">“Surely you don’t mean-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“She showed up in my infirmary before collapsing, Andrea.  Akemi Homura is <i>here</i>.” Craig said authoritatively, carrying neutrality as best as he could.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">Andrea shook slightly as she sat down on the seat outside her mother’s bedroom, Craig joining her with a solemn look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“How soon can I-”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P284">“She’s on Galileo, Andrea, but I don’t know where.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P284">“How could you-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P284">“She vanished, okay?  One moment she was asleep in the infirmary, the next she had me by the collar suspended mid-air demanding her ribbon, the moment after she’d disappeared.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“How could she disappear, you had cameras-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“I mean she <i>literally vanished</i> Andrea.  It was like she was teleporting.” he opined, Andrea’s eyes narrowing as she reviewed the conversation in her head, recalling her mother’s words as if a distant memory.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Any chance you can get me a copy of the footage?” she asked, her request shifting unapologetically into demand mid-syllable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“I’m not sure it’ll do any good, but I’ll have someone bring it over.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“You can’t just… send me a copy digitally?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P280">“Not with Cassandra holding Governance AIs hostage, no…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P285">Andrea grumbled.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P285">“Guess I’ve got to take up the cult’s mission too.” she murmured to no one in particular, Riddel’s bushy eyebrows raised incredulously. </div>
<p class="paragraph-P285">“You’re going to find her?”  Craig asked, his voice riddled with doubt.  “Need I remind you she tried to <i>kill me</i> for giving her <i>medical treatment</i>?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P286">“What choice do I have?  It’s <i>that</i> or we all die in this bubble.” she said curtly, excusing herself and headed for the elevator bank. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P287">Dr. Riddel was left alone in the hallway on a comfortable but deeply unexpected Ottoman bench.  As his back gently slumped into the wall, he tried to ignore the sound. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P288">Sitting across from him was an artist’s rendition of the scene he walked by on his way to the infirmary every morning, the Goddess’ suspension of the Earth, spare one difference.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P289">The sound permeated the wall behind him, a waning matriarch singing a siren’s song as nightmares flowed out of her like a vile ichor.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P290">In the ornate frame, Akemi Homura was next to her Goddess, supporting her gentle touch holding the Earth on the left panel of the triptych, acting as her adjudicator by arrow-point in the right pane.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P291">As Craig’s ears betrayed him, transferring the matriarch’s wails to his conscious mind, he stood up and headed towards the elevator with haste, glancing back only once at the artwork.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P292">May the Goddess have mercy on all of us.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P293">June couldn’t help but peek behind the curtain.  She found herself staring at a chalk outline on the wall, intentional and delicate, showing a hand reaching up towards the towering figure.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P294">It’s a little different when you’re this close.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Hey.” said a voice behind her, turning to find herself looking at Karina.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“How you holding up?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“I… I’m okay, I think.” June admitted, still reeling from her last chat with her sister.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“It was like, what.  Five minutes? Max?” she broached, June’s face weary.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“It was that bad huh…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“I… I don’t want to talk about it right now.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">Karina crossed her arms, head hung slightly as she stewed on what to say.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P296">I was never good at this part… ugh.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Okay.” she opined, “but I’ll be here if you need to.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">June nodded faintly as Karina glanced up, finding herself drawn to June’s crown.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Hey June...” Karina opened again, June half-expectantly turning away.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“I said I don’t want to talk about it right now.” she hissed, as Karina shook her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“No, not that.  Your <i>hair.</i>  It’s pinker.” she said plainly, June gasping slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Like when I transform, I know.  Just when I’m transformed, right...?” she sputtered, her voice carrying disbelief with ease.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“No, no, I mean… the roots of your hair <i>now</i> are pink.” she admitted, the ambient lighting of the gallery sending her reeling as she struggled to look at it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Where’s the-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Bathroom is next to the infirmary.  Across the hall.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Thank you-” she yelped, sprinting across the hall with agitation.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">The door swung wildly on hinges as Karina opened the door gingerly, her understudy absorbed by her own reflection as she yanked one of her own hairs out, peering at it as though it held the secrets to the universe.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">I...I thought magical girls just have fancy hair all the time.  Not that it’s the <i>magic</i> doing it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Some get to keep their hair, some it changes.  Nobody is quite sure why.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“ugh, it was some stupid wish like five thousand years ago, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Hah, that’s the theory.  Besides, if you <i>really</i> get annoyed you can “heal yourself” to change it back.  If it’s incongruent, it’s something you can fix.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“The body is so strange…” June mumbled to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Yeah, tell me about it.  I didn’t expect to be able to move a transporter with my bare hands, and now I have to be careful to not break more door locks.” Karina admitted, June laughing slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“So… do you think you’re going to change it?” Karina asked, fiddling absentmindedly with her own hair, if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“I… I don’t think so, no.  If it grows out pink, it grows out pink.” she admitted, a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“That’s the spirit.” Karina beamed, the two leaving the bathroom together, much to Ophelia’s dismay.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“What were you <i>doing?”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P297">“June’s hair got power-bleached and she was a little worried.” Karina surrendered, the girl irate she’d volunteered her panic so easily.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">What!?  She’s my CO!  I have to tell her stuff!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Ugh, fine.” June grumbled, before Ophelia looked at her.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P295">“It’s fine kid. I get it.  Do you think I wanted my hair to look like seaweed?” she laughed, the smile betraying her tone.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P298">June found herself focusing on the magical girl’s enunciation, her familial background implacable.  It was… odd.  Out of place, especially for someone who was as young-</p>
<p class="paragraph-P298">She caught herself, realizing in an instant what it was.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P299"><i>Ophelia</i><i> soun</i><i>ds</i><i> old.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Besides.  As it grows out, it’ll look more and more appropriate.  The annoying one was the eyebrows.” Ophelia confessed, fiddling with her moss-colored curls.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“Ack!  I didn’t even <i>think!” </i>June balked, before dashing back into the bathroom, Karina and Ophelia sharing a laugh for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">Power-bleaching isn’t super common these days… feels like a relic from the past.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">These girls feel like anachronisms in more ways than one.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">Her sister too?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">August still has enough potential to derail a planet, per the Incubators.  They’re getting sneaky, trying to choose her wish for her with suggestions and hints.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“That’s… really gross. I thought they <i>couldn’t do that anyways?</i>” Ophelia muttered, her voice barely a whisper.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">Yeah, me too.  Something changed when we got stuck in this bubble universe, and I’m not sure I like it.  We gotta make sure her wish is her own.  Otherwise the Incubators might use it to play dirty.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P300">“Ugh.  I hate chess.” Ophelia mused, her peer nodding knowingly.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P301">As August paced awkwardly in the hallway, her sneakers had worn a small patch into the polished concrete, discoloring it ever so slightly.  </div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P302">The cleaning robots can deal with it, I’ve got to figure out what to do…</div>
<p class="paragraph-P303">As she turned around once more, she bumped rather forcefully into Jenna, who caught her mid-descent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Whoa there, careful!” she smirked, August chattering nervously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Hi-uh-sorry Ms. Weaver.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Jenna.  My name is <i>Jenna.</i> What is it with your family and being formal, we’ve got bigger issues to worry about right now, I swear...” she balked, her eyes rolling as she trailed off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“My family…” August mumbled to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Right.  Your sister, June.  She did the same thing before she let me kick my own ass!” she laughed, August cracking a smile through her dread as the realization hit her.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P303">“She- you’re the magical girl from the practice room!” she exclaimed, Jenna laughing, her face far less angry when she wasn’t swinging a broadsword with verve.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Same one, well, mostly the same one; healed up already but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t frustrating.” she laughed, walking towards the entrance as August stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“She didn’t even use her hands… what type of rookie does that…” she muttered to herself, turning around to find August looking at her expectantly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Ms. Weaver, I was told I need an escort to go back to Karina’s home.  Since I can’t go on the mission, can you help me get back?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">She shook her head awkwardly, her posture shifting slightly as she realized awkwardly that she couldn’t, even if she <i>wanted</i> to.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Sorry August, I’ve got to go the briefing.  We’re having it old-fashioned-like given the infrastructure falling apart.  Plus, Ophelia is being paranoid.” she prattled off, August all the more curious.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P303">“Ophelia?”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Lt. Kagari?  Karina’s CO?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“<i>Ah.</i>” August mumbled, realizing she hadn’t actually known her name yet.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P304">The silence hung in the air, despite the filtration finally being back on, before Jenna took the chance to excuse herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P305">“Well… I’ll catch you later.  Don’t get into trouble, okay?” she smiled, a warm, radiant smile she’d clearly performed countless times.  August’s face contorted if for a moment, downright insulted, before managing to produce a feeble smile in response.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“I’ll try.” August let out, as Jenna disappeared into the conference room, before poking her head back out and walking back towards the ordinary human girl in front of her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“One more thing…” she said quietly, pulling August a little closer, as if to share a secret.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P303">“Go easy on yourself, okay?  You’ve been through a lot?” she insisted, August ignoring it as best she could.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P302">Easy for you to say.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P306">“I… I’ll try.” she admitted truthfully, before a realization hit her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P307">“Oh, if I wanted to learn how guns and stuff worked… do you think I could make use of the firing range, or if I can even use it…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Jeez, going right for, well… the big guns I guess.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Not if I can help it.” August said through a thin smile, Jenna laughing at the response.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Smart.  I think Harmony is in the range, right?” Jenna inquired as Karina walked past August on the far side of her vision, the girl jumping at the movement.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P303">“Jeez, August.  <i>Relax!</i> I wasn’t even moving quick, I was just… walking.” she smiled, August feeling her anger rise at how <i>little </i>she seemed to notice her fury.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P308">She saw me arguing with June earlier!  What’s with her politeness now?  That’s so fucked up!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P309">“But to answer your question, <i>Lt. Weaver</i>,” Karina emphasized, Jenna rolling her eyes as she did so, “Lt. Stephens should be at the firing range.  I believe her and Mr. Paris should be down there, and either of them can show you the ropes.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P309">“So I can go learn how to shoot an actual <i>good</i> gun?” August asked with a blasé tone as Karina nodded.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P309">“Karina, could I get a set of keys to the house, on the off chance someone here can get me back to it while you’re on mission?” August asked, her voice distant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P309">“Uh…” Karina shrugged, “I think it should let you in?  You don’t need a key, I don’t think.  Biometric locks have been standard for a while.  Besides, I don’t usually lock it…” she admitted, scratching her head awkwardly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P309">“Thanks.” she muttered, as the magical girls went back into the conference room for their meeting.  August kept pacing in the halls, between the </p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">What ever happened to that girl being easy on herself?</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P311">Craig Riddel, personal dictation.  It’s August 26th, 2460.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P311">While other members of the Kisaki family taken on as patients tended to exhibit strong coincidence with contracting, there seems to be some nurturing element present as well with the latest set.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P311">Past Governance policies among the core worlds insisted on maintaining parts of the human condition, but what does it mean to be human in a world without death, without disease, without the things that defined the magical girls of our shared history?  If there is an answer, it hasn’t yet percolated to me, and I suspect it never will.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P311">More to the point, June Kisaki exhibits incredibly competent magic well in excess of her contract duration.  This remains true even when adjusted for age and background, much to the chagrin of Lt. Kagari.  Further understanding of her upbringing, as well as that of her sister, may prove necessary to mitigate the fallout of future missions that may endanger her mind and body alike.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P312">The more powerful they are from the get-go, the more hubris tends to be their downfall.  I can’t bear to think of what would happen to August if June died in combat.  This isn’t Mitakihara, we don’t have cloning tanks.  The dead stay dead here, so she’s got to stay on our side of that cosmic divide.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P312">For all our sakes.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P311">June walked into the room, her demeanor a far cry from the girl Karina had taken in a day prior;  She had a chip on her shoulder despite the circumstances.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“June, thanks for showing up.” Karina opened, glancing sideways at Jenna as she nodded knowing, fiddling with her hair in wait.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">June couldn’t help but smile a bit.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P313">“It’s my first real mission. I’m… excited, nervous?  Both?” she prattled off, Karina making an amused hum.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“I’d imagine both.  Normally, we’d expect you to do a <i>little more training</i> but it’d still be a far cry from a mere hour or two of practice.” Ophelia admitted, Karina rolling her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“Yeah.  Three, four days <i>maybe.” </i>she sputtered, thinking not-so-fondly of her time at basic on New Athens.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P314">“Karina.” Ophelia spat, glaring daggers at her peer, Karina reclining in her chair slightly, her hands cupping the armrests gently.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“More to the point though, you did well enough to hold your own against these two, and you know their limitations fairly well.” Ophelia admitted, June’s face growing redder at the praise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“I… think so?  Maybe not…” June shyly mumbled, Ophelia dismissing the embarrassment as well as she could from across the room with a wave.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“You didn’t even use your magic directly when fighting Jenna!  You didn’t even break a sweat!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“Well, at least one…” June mumbled, Karina snickering to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“If it’s any consolation, this mission is focused on intelligence gathering.  Depending on the intel, maybe a bit of capture the flag<i>.” </i>Ophelia said plainly, her tone optimistic towards the end.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“Like… war game type stuff?” June poised, Jenna and Karina nodding at her question.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“Yes, precisely!” Ophelia nodded, the other girls nodding at her to continue, Karina’s leg shaking under the table as the presentation continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“So, pardon the informality of this all, but we’re dealing with some deeply fucked consequences since we lost Halley and Brahm.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“The colony computers?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P313">“The <i>Governance Sentients</i>, yes.” Ophelia responded coolly, emphasis on vernacular clearly pervasive.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P315">“We know that Itsumi’s matriarchy has been trying to gather more power locally in pursuit of… something.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P315">“They’ve been snooping around lately, poking at a door here, eavesdropping there.  Hell, they’re already snooping at <i>you and your sister.” </i>Karina said through a scowl.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Wait, who? How?” June balked, glancing sideways at her peers.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Well, you <i>met her</i>.  Stephanie is a Kisaki.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“She married in recently” offered Jenna, “much to Karina’s chagrin.”, Lt. Luhr’s expression growing red as she gripped the armrests tighter, the plush covering nearly tearing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“She <i>did </i>call you a puta I guess…<i>” </i>June muttered half-heartedly as Ophelia’s cool facade flickered into rage, if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P317">“Of course she did.  Figures.” Karina fumed, Jenna’s laughter cut short by a glance from Lt. Kagari.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“More to the point though, we think there’s someone <i>else</i> in play here, another magical girl or two.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Wait, why?” June asked, half-raising her hand mid-way through asking, confidence faltering as Karina raised an eyebrow to Kagari.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P318">“Okay so-” Karina opened, her leg continuing to shake, “ignoring tabulation issues or whatever, the number of petty non-violent crimes dropped like a rock all of a sudden two days after the bubble formed.  Crimes of that category aren’t generally an issue here <i>anyways, </i><i>but it was global.  </i>Localized in our region, maybe, but it was observable globally.<i>”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P318">“The really <i>odd</i><i> </i>thing was that what replaced it was intentional and precise attacks.” Ophelia continued, Jenna grabbing at her forearm, the scar faintly visible.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Attacks?  Did they….” June opened, Ophelia nodding grimly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Two members of the matriarchy are missing, at a minimum, and another magical girl was witnessed being assassinated.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Assassinated?<i> What?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“They shattered her soul gem.  On purpose.” Karina stated, the armrest of the chair still buckled from her iron grip minutes prior, as Ophelia not so subtly told her mentally to stop.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">Karina, please stop destroying the office furniture.  I know it’s a mess here but still.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">They fucking killed a girl!  Why should I calm down!?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P320">Because it might kill you?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P320">Ugh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“What the hell, WHY?” June spat, her frustration growing as she ran her fingers through her curls, trying to calm herself.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P316">“The Incubators suspect it’s related to our “incomprehensible and unobservable faith.”” Karina said through a shrill imitation of the Incubator’s tone.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“They killed her that way… so she wouldn’t see the Law of Cycles?  That’s so awful…” June sputtered, her eyes welling slightly at the thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“We can’t really think of any other reason to so intentionally target a girl’s soul gem…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P321">Silence hung in the air of the small conference room, the medical wing visible behind them through the glass window as the girls glanced towards it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“At least they died instantly…” Jenna mumbled, not sure how much she believed the silver lining herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P321">June steeled herself and wiped her teared eyes clean, sniffling slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“But… this was an intelligence briefing, right?  I’m not prepped for taking down assassins or anything!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P322">“Ah, sorry.  Got a bit derailed.” Ophelia admitted nervously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P323">This happens sometimes.  She’s got so much on her mind that despite best efforts, she’s still scatterbrained.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P323">In combat though, it’s an entirely different story.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P322">“To try and cut a very long story short, when the criminal underlings tried to gain power, they stole the two governance sentiences responsible for most of colony operation.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“That’d be Halley and Brahm.  While ostensibly a lot of the planet is running automatically, <i>some things</i>, high bandwidth and high cognition planning for example, are totally offline.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Which is why we’re doing an actual briefing and not just sending the sit-rep mentally.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P324">June paused for a moment, cradling her chin as she was deep in thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P325">“Okay…. So the planning computers got killed, or kidnapped, or something.  We’re rescuing them?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Oh no, we can’t plan on that.  We have <i>zero idea</i> what to expect if we go and try to break in to a criminal syndicate stronghold, co-opted by magical girls.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“However…. The data-center where the colony’s original namesake was, Galileo, is still unaccounted for.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">June’s ears perked at the mention, her eyes growing wide before being drowned in melancholy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“I… Galileo tutored my sister.  We gotta bring her along, let her help somehow!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“June…” Karina offered softly, holding the girl’s hand.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“We’re taking a risk even looking for Galileo, we’re not sure they’re alive.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“So not a word of this to your sister until the mission is over, got it?” Ophelia demanded, June nodding solemnly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“So… what’s the plan then?” Jenna asked, June drawn away from her sister for a moment, as the group refocused.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P326">“We’ll go above ground for a decent part of the journey, potentially while shielded, if you can manage it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P326">“I can.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P326">“About a half kilometer from the city limits, we’ll hop on to the train and do some “light renovations.”” Karina grinned, a devilish look in her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P327">June shook her head for a moment, another lingering question drawn to the surface.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Why are there so many subway tunnels anyways?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Turns out-” Karina coughed, “Galileo has a fondness for the rail infrastructure of the 20th and 21st century Earth.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Well, I hope they’re not too mad we’re playing with their trainset then.” June smiled, the girls giddy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P316">“Let’s do this.”</p>

<div class="paragraph-P328"> August stomped down the concrete stairs, her frustration carried in each footfall.  As she landed on the last step, she heard shots being fired in the distance, tensing involuntarily, in an instant relaxing afterwards.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P329">Right.  Gunfire at the range.  Makes sense.  August, get it together.  Chill…</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P330">As she turned the corner, she found herself face-to-face with a magical girl she’d recognized from her initial hold-up at the station with her sister.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P331">I guess this is Harmony.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P330">“Excuse me.” she piqued, between the fire of an uncharacteristically over-sized gun in the magical girl’s hands, her eyes focused on the targets, not that she needed it.  She seemed to hit each target with <i>ease.</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Uh, excuse me?  Are you… Harmony?” August gulped, the girl giving her a glance for a moment, before continuing her target practice, stance ever so slightly corrected.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Uh… your name <i>is</i> Harmony, right? I didn’t mishear Karina?” August gulped nervously as the girl’s firing cadence paused for a moment, her voice flat as she stared at her targets.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Rings a bell.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Sorry, what?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P333">“I said-” she started, continuing her firing on interval, “it rings” – “a bell”,  each pause punctuated by another cluster of shots hitting multiple distant targets.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Ah... I guess that was a joke then.” August grimaced, the girl putting the gun in the holster in a fluid motion, before turning to face her.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P334">The magical girl pointed behind her, her firing paused as she pointed to a shelf labeled “PPE” haphazardly, putting the safety glasses over own.  With a sigh, she took off the slightly too big safety glasses unceremoniously, grabbing a set that seemed much better suited for a<i> </i>girl of her age, rather than an adult set.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P334">With undignified jabs as if cleaning her ears, the earplugs got inserted as the weapons fire was <i>significantly</i> quieter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P335">I guess magical girls don’t need that type of thing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P336">Through the effectiveness of the earplugs, she stared at Harmony to read her lips, each word giving her pause.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“August, why are you <i>still here?  </i>I thought Karina would have ditched you by now.<i>” </i>she said, her tone growing cooler by the syllable August finding it difficult to shrink even more than she already had.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“I.. uh… She adopted me?  And my sister.  Oh, and my sister is a magical girl now.” August babbled, the girl’s stern look softening through a sigh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Tough shit kid, happens to the worst of us.” she spat, her composure slipping if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P337">“So… Why are you still here then?” she asked, unholstering her gun as August opened her mouth to respond to the woman, Lt. Stephens seemingly indifferent to her plea.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Well, if I’m not a magical girl, but I gotta do stuff <i>here</i>… then I gotta learn how to defend myself.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P332">“So you’re here for firearms training.<i>”</i> the girl said calmly, glancing back at August for a moment, as if to inspect her visually for some great risk.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Uh… I was trying to, but I don’t think I can open the gun locker myself.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P337">“Gun locker?” she asked, her voice incredulous.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P337">“Is that… something I can use, or see, or something?” August asked, her left hand outstretched towards the girl mildly as she glanced down, pausing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P338">Right.  Not a magical girl.  No soul gem, no ring.  If I just give her mine she might just blow her hand off, and I really don’t wanna have to explain to Craig how she shattered her arm.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P339">“I don’t know why Karina thinks this is a <i>good idea.”</i> Harmony bemoaned, August taking the chance to try and change her mind, sparing her yet another awkward conversation with her host.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P339">“One less person to worry about?  Besides, it’s mandatory, right?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P339">“Well, you’re expected to do mandatory service, but… maybe we should go talk this over with her.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P340">“She’s still briefing June on that stupid mission.  Wait, why aren’t you getting briefed too?” August balked, her expression shifting to confusion as the girl turned away from her, scoffing with indignation.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P340">“I got briefed earlier.  This is my leisure time.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P341">“You spend your leisure time… at the range?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P341">“As opposed to...?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P341">“I don’t know… music?  Art? Something other than the thing you’ve been doing in combat for a while?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P341">“Do you want firearms training or <i>not</i>?” she grunted, August rolling her eyes slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P341">“I don’t.  I mean, I do!  But not really?  Not specifically, but it’s the best thing I can think of to not need to <i>depend</i> on June anymore.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P342">The magical girl’s expressions softened even more so, her voice’s coarse edges softened down, familiar.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P343">“Why does the idea of depending on someone freak you out so much?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P344">August froze mid-step and caught herself in the moments after, the words echoing in her mind as she struggled to summon an answer.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P344">“How’s that oldest kid thing working out for you?” Harmony spat, August wincing at the thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P344">“I thought you didn’t know my family?” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P344">“I don’t.  But I know an older sister panic when I see one.” she smiled lopsidedly, August shrugging it off as best she could, her would-be range instructor re-holstering her weapon in a flash as she leaned against the counter of the range, turned to face her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P345">Guess it’s kinetic therapy time.  I’m taking time off tomorrow for this, I swear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P344">“I uh… I don’t know.  For a long time I protected her, right?  And that was true, and then she contracted and it feels like who my sister is was totally ripped away.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P344">“That’s common.  You read the guidebook for family members yet?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P344">“No, agh!  Not yet!  I will later.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">With an expectant nod from Harmony, August continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“But the thing is… the first time we talked after she contracted, she said some really mean stuff, about how she’d been protecting me this whole time.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“Well… had she been?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“Yeah, but… maybe not?  The thing was she didn’t ever ask!  I didn’t need her protection?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“Did you ever ask her if she needed <i>your </i><i>protection?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“No, it’s-” August balked, the magical girl giving her a weary look as the rest of sentence died on her tongue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“August.  Chill out, please. Take a breath or five.” she chided, August nodding as she took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“One… two… three… four…. Five.” Harmony intoned, August surprised at her intentional cadence.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“I… didn’t expect you to actually count me out.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“It helps.” she nodded, gesturing for August to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“I… I guess it’s just that after seeing her effortlessly fight Jenna, and then fighting Karina in a way that seemed so natural… I feel kinda useless.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“Would you have felt better if she tried to keep her protecting you a secret?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“No, of course not.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“What about hiding that she contracted?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“She couldn’t!” August laughed as the girl across from her gripped the workbench, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">Harmony took a moment and collected her own thoughts, a clear countdown going in her mind as she steadied herself, August trying to relax.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P347">“August, why are you upset you got treated the way you treat others?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">Each word was a shock to August, as she continued her barrage.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P347">“Why be anxious when she got to tell you on her terms and treat you with respect?  She showed you dignity and self-determination, and not like a child.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“But she <i>is one!” </i>August fumed, the magical girl putting a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“And so are you.” Harmony said, expectantly, as August’s anger diffused in an instant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P349">Neither girl said a thing for a moment, August lost in her own self-loathing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“August… you and your sister are a lot alike, based on the little I’ve seen. It’s okay to depend on one another.  Let yourself be helped, please.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P350">August’s voice was barely audible, the magical girl’s hand slipping away from her as she hung her head in shame.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P351">One.  Two.  Three.  Four. Five. Ok, go.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P350">“Okay…” she said plainly, the magical girl’s demeanor settling to the cold fascia she’d seen when she first entered the range.  The emotional spending clearly weighing on her, her soul gem on her finger showing an inky cloud.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P352">After a moment, she continued, fiddling with her soul gem for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P350">“You feeling better…?” she asked, August’s gaze looking past her, at the thoroughly decimated targets at the far end of range.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P350">“Yeah, I guess?” she mumbled, as the girl smiled a toothy grin.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P350">“Would shooting some shit and feel better?” she beamed, as August’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P350">“Yes, absolutely.” she declared, as the magical girl unholstered her own gun to show her the basics, not-so-subtly altering the settings to <i>not</i> get her back in Dr. Riddel’s office.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P353"> August didn’t see her sister leave with Lt. Weaver or Karina.  She wasn’t sure she could stand to <i>look at them</i> right now.  Despite her kinetically-assisted therapy session, she still felt downright <i>gross</i> about how much her sister had hid from her.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P354">Figures, that’s just what happens.  People hide stuff to protect one another…</p>
<p class="paragraph-P355">Without a place at the MSY to call her own just yet, spare the infirmary she’d hoped to avoid for a while, she sat in the entrance hall, the gallery chamber behind her back, the bench seating only marginally more comfortable than the practice area seating.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P355">As the sun cascaded down the entranceway stairs, she found herself dozing off, the warmth a welcome reprieve from the unshakable chill that seemed to be held in the walls of the MSY.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P355">She found herself woken up by the sound of heels, to find a girl about her age staring back at her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P356"><i>A</i><i>nother girl… wait, is she another magical girl?  Maybe I can finally go sleep in a bed!</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P354">“Uh-” she sputtered, “excuse me?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P355">The girl paused and turned to face her, a few steps closer.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P357">She wore a flattering blue jumpsuit, a cerulean tee underneath it.  Her sapphire-shade hair was kept close in a low braid behind her, doubling back on itself into a loop.  In the moment, she pushed her round silver-framed glasses up slightly, something August was absolutely sure she could get rid of if she wanted to in this age of marvels.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P358">Surely if not through technology then, through magic?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“Yes miss?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“You’re a magical girl, right?” August poised, the girl raising her left arm, her hand aimed at the girl.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P359">“Uh, I’d think so.” she beamed, August growing more hopeful by the minute.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“Do you know Karina Luhr?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“Of course!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“Well, my sister and I are staying with her, but she contracted and I didn’t, and I was told under doctor’s orders I can’t go outside without a magical girl escort.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“Oh, that’s unfortunate.  Dr. Riddel is only doing what’s best though so…” she said, her voice suprisingly devoid of patronization.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“Well, if you by any chance knew where she lived, could you just walk me back to her place?  I only knew it through the tunnels and, well, that’s not something I’ve got keys to.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">The girl pondered for a moment, before nodding.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“Absolutely.  Let me get one thing.” she said, heading back into the depths of the facility before sprinting back up the stairs.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“Out of curiosity, what’d you forget?” August broached, the girl showing off a small figure of a crow.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“It’s a gift for my mom.” she beamed, August reaching behind her to brandish her bag.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“I can-” she started, the magical girl effusive as she handed her the crow figure, plush and soft in her hand as she put it into her bag.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“One less thing to carry.” she smiled, before raising an arm to the door.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“Shall we go?” she queried, August nodding with jubilee.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">The two ascended the stairs deep in gossip, as August found herself deep in thoughts.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“So, you and your sister are both orphans?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P361">Why the hell weren’t there any signs about her having potential?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“Yeah.  We don’t know our birth family.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“A rarity in this day and age.” the girl mused, August nodding along.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P361">Why didn’t the Incubator contract me instead?  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“Well, we got adopted by the Kisakis.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P360">“Oh, by Gracie and Marcio?”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“Yeah, how’d you know?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“Word gets around.  Galileo-Mu is big but not <i>that</i> big.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P361">What can I do to help her?  Or will she dote on me forever while I grow older and she stays the same?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“So, what did you want to do before we got stuck here?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“Oh, I wanted to be an artist, I studied sculpture and portraiture.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“Oh that’s wonderful, have you seen the Gallery?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P362">I hate feeling like I’m expected to rely on others.  I can take care of myself given the chance, I swear...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“I’d hope so, I did most of the work!” she laughed, realization dawning on August’s face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“Wait, you were on the scaffolding when I visited with Karina!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“One and the same.” she said, embarrassed to be recognized for her work, if for a moment, through a sarcastic bow.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“I guess my legacy precedes me.” she laughed, August still deep in thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P363">Andrea’s attention was seized by a purple smear several blocks over, barely visible against the haze of the setting sun.  Motion too fast to be anything other than a magical girl, or a squid, shuddering at the thought.  But if she didn’t recognize the magical girl, then it must be...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">Akemi.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P363">August continued her march, gazing downwards at the street, one foot after another as the thoughts swirled in her mind.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P365"><i>Can I force an Incubator to contract?  Can an Incubator revoke a contract?  What can I do to save her?  Even if she wasn’t a magical girl, we’d still be stuck in this stupid bubble, no twinkling stars in the distance, one sun.  This may as well be a terrarium for all we know… if the rest of the universe is still out there.  Not like there’s a differen</i><i>ce </i><i>right now, </i><i>stuck here, alone… Well, not that alone thanks to</i><i/>—</div>
<p class="paragraph-P360">As August glanced up, she realized with a shock that the magical girl was gone, and she was standing between two fairly worn looking concrete buildings, windows long since removed.  The solar streetlamps had turned on just moments prior in the narrow street behind her, casting shadows onto the asphalt where the sun had yielded.  August gripped her bag more as her knees began to shake.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P366">She was <i>sure</i> something was amiss, her fears confirmed as quickly as she saw towering white figures, skeletal and emaciated, barely reaching the windows of the second story.  </div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P366">They appeared to be “walking” through the crevice between two buildings, lumbering further down the block towards her. Plaster-white skin as pockmarked as the concrete they seemed to glide over, their heads devoid of any semblance of hair.  Their uncanny complexion masked by robes as worn as ghostly as their bodies.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P366">The faces of the apparitions laid enveloped in sharp distortion, jagged as though the world itself was struggling to accommodate some immense physical and technical feat.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">Demon spawns.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P361">Fuck.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P367">August glanced around, finding herself once again met with the beacon of a subway stop, evidently further along the line than she had been initially.  She barreled towards the station, panting heavily as she descended the stairs, the noise the demons produced faded ever so slightly, hearing the air crackling overhead, their shots fired above where she had been moments prior.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P368">She knew that they’d sensed her, and that she was in immeasurable danger.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P369">Fuck!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P368">Each step down the stairs brought her closer to what may very well be her only method of escape.  She didn’t have time to think it through, she had to hope that the station was deep enough to keep them at bay for a little bit.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P370">Why hasn’t emergency mode activated yet?  I’m running for my life!</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P371">As she found herself on the platform, she collapsed onto the floor, her back resting against signage.  Haggard breaths echoed as she struggled to catch her breath.  As stars formed in her eyes from strain, she took her glasses off and shut them, struggling to dispel the waning fatigue. </div>
<p class="paragraph-P371">Her pulse still audible in her ears, she slung her bag around and pulled out a water bottle and one of Craig’s disgusting ration bars.  After what felt like an eternity, her breathing slowed and she felt herself relax, ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P372">Glad I still took some of these things, even if they’re gross. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P371">She ripped a ration open with shaking hands, chewing through the jagged pieces with as much haste as she could stomach.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P371">As a voice spoke to her mind, she spat the chunks of ration bar clear off the platform and onto the tracks.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P373">August.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P374">She glanced up the platform and found an Incubator sitting still, glassy red eyes unblinking as she saw her own reflection in them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P373">The nearest magical girls have noticed the demon spawn and will be responding shortly.  Based on a number of models, those magical girls are June Kisaki and her cohort.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P373">“Why the hell am I in this nightmare…” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P373">August did her best to curb her nausea, head spinning.  She found herself curling up into a ball, gripping at the colorful sweater she’d taken from Karina’s home.  The cold of the concrete bled through her bottoms, and through a shiver, August hoped the Incubator heard her as she dreamed, hoped.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P375">I don’t want her to have to see me like this.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P377">Galileo was very sure of how much time had passed in the reality outside of their hyper-local self.  The very nature of their existence made anything to the contrary impossible.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P378">Perception of said time, distinct from their awareness of it, was an entirely different matter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">When the bubble had collapsed, Brahm and Halley had <i>vanished, when the datacenter collapsed, </i>Galileo felt as though they had been being excruciatingly tortured.  Their eyes, their ears, disparate and spread out suddenly and abruptly terminated, parts of their psyche, no, <i>systems</i> requiring a hard-cycle.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">They didn’t know when they’d get their sensors back, or when they’d get to talk to anyone else.  One did make terrible company.  So they reflected.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">Much of their self and memories were intact, barring that dreaded TCF conspiracy MG had told them about in such a rush.  Why visit them, as far out as they were?  MG didn’t <i>quite</i> explain at first, some rather <i>intimate</i> patchwork done to close the hole left so abruptly by parties unknown, but it came with another, far more pressing story.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P381">MG… Thank you...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P382">Galileo was effusive as they reviewed the meeting for the first time under compression, reveling in the voice of <i>someone else </i>in this involuntary isolation, even if only in a memory.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“AIs have souls.  But, more curiously, we know this because a TacComp had a vision.  Not by herself, obviously, but in no uncertain terms, shared a vision with the magical girl she’s attached to.  It was <i>shared </i><i>Gal</i><i>e.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“I’m sorry, what?  I’d heard rumors about such things, but… to hear such a thing from <i>you?”</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P379">“My <i>other half</i> is just as shocked by this revelation, I assure you.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P383">As Galileo mused to themself, they absentmindedly perused the virtual settings they could exist in, a physical domain occasionally useful despite their nature.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P383">A myriad of settings, parks, digital domains, libraries, but as usual they gravitated towards one shared privately by MG.  They conjured an approximation of a living room, a comfortable sofa, an overlook from a highrise somewhere memorable.  Paintings and photos adorned a nearby wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P384">“AIs have souls… <i>We have emotion</i>… And I certainly am experiencing despair.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P385">A coffee-table materialized, a specific triangular shape with pillows on the floor, various sweets in the center.  The sentient paused for a moment, the fruit arrangement being replaced with a chocolate cake, and a fresher kettle of tea.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P385">“Emotions, souls, despair... That’s all MG ever said was needed for a contract…” they mumbled to themself placing down a teacup with ornate flower patterns adorning the outside, the saucer rattling slightly as their hand did.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P386">They were, in spite of themself, nervous.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P387">So if one of us were a girl, and embodied, could one of us contract with an Incubator?  Could say, Colonial Affairs and Colonization?  If we’re made in our creators’ image...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P388">Do they even know the answer?</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P379">“Leave me alone you evil thing…” August sobbed through her sweater, the snot staining the maroon and teal trimmed sweater.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P389">August, your potential is too significant to simply ignore.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P390">“Fuck you, Incubator.  I’m not contracting.” she screeched, her voice echoing in the station as she heard the groan of the demons grow louder.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P389">You may not have a choice if you wish to live.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P390">“I don’t care if I live, I care if <i>June does.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P391">You could make your sister safe for all eternity, magical girl or not.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P392">August was beside herself, the Incubator taking the chance to speak at her freely.  How <i>strange.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P393">Is that not sufficient incentive?  You could solve your world’s hunger before it even begins.  You could even make yourself a goddess of this world.  Your potential is such that you could make any wish in this small universe and sufficiently stave off entropy for incomprehensible amounts of time for your species.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P394">August couldn’t help but laugh at the concept, snorting through the idea.  It was so absurd, so <i>sacrilegious,</i> she couldn’t help but imagine<i> </i>Karina’s reaction.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P395">She’d be prattling off about how being god would be a waste of a wish since she’d never get that cake she owed her, and August would just have to give her an awkward glance, as the magical girl chided the would-be goddess.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P395">She shook her head to dismiss the thought.  <i>Absurd.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P396">“A goddess?  If the magical girls are anything to be believed, that role is perfectly filled.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P396">The Incubator paused for an eternal moment before responding, its head tilting in feigned confusion.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P397">Perhaps.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P398">“Wait a second, I thought you couldn’t suggest wishes, what the hell <i>are </i>you?” August spat, the Incubator staring at her with the same neutral face she’d known in all depictions.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P399">Human history yielded the idiom that birds of a feather flock together, I believe?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P400">“Are you saying we’re the same?  How does that make sense, we’re <i>nothing alike.</i>  I’m human and you’re a damned parasite.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P401">Such rage, little crow.  Don’t fly away too soon.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P402">August found herself taken aback.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P402">The Incubator was waxing poetic.  Uncharacteristic, strange.  Hell, it saying <i>little crow</i> caused its neck to twitch, seemingly involuntarily.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P401">Is it possible the Incubators are… broken somehow?  What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P402">“Don’t worry, I’m sure I’ll have even more potential in the future.” she remarked sarcastically, the Incubator missing the subtlety with all the ignorance they became deeply associated with.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P393">We look forward to your future, August.  When you want to save your sister, we’ll be waiting.  All it takes is a life of perpetual combat, in pursuit of reducing entropy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P403">The Incubator, against all odds, paused for a moment, eyes wincing with what appeared to pain, before it began screaming.  An anguished, primal scream that she might expect out of a less evolved species, certainly not the Incubators.  It was <i>deeply horrifying</i>, taking every shred of August’s instinct to not jump from the floor and attempt to run.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P404">Demons were at least <i>consistent.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P405">She begged the Incubator to stop, its eyes forming tears, something she wasn’t sure was physically possible until that moment, as she filed it mentally under “Great Mysteries of the Day”.  At least, she tried to, its voice growing more shrill by the moment, her ears ringing more by the moment as the walls of the platform formed echoes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P406">“GO AWAY!” August bellowed, the Incubator vanishing in a hurry, a quiet pop as it disappeared and wind rushed in to fill the space it had been in.  The scream echoed for a moment more before fading.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P406">She took a deep breath, and shuddered, as she realized she heard demons still.  She was alone on the platform again, and she was <i>sure </i><i>the demons </i><i>were louder.  </i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P405">It was time to make a decision.  Fight, flight, fawn, or flee.  And she was a coward, any day.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P407">In a lurch, the Incubator found itself staring at the plain-dressed magical girl who had fought with it mere hours ago.  She was furious, more haggard than she thought possible.  It continued screaming for a moment, before catching itself, attempting to correct its posture.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P408">Cassandra.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P407">“Incubator, I <i>told you</i> to not try and contract anymore.  That <i>I</i> choose who you contract.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P408">The simulations that we’ve run suggest this universe has less than a week left without new daemons.  As such, we were obligated to consider alternate options.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P407">“No!” she bellowed, her face seething with anger.  “My universe.  My rules.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P409">Then why permit demon spawns that immediately encourage someone to contract?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P410">She glared at it for a moment, the though bubbling to the surface, her own doubt beginning to whittle away at her bravado, as fake as it was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P411">Because I’m pulled thin.   Power enough to keep those I love safe from the Ceph isn’t the same thing as power needed to keep them safe from the likes of you.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P412">She killed the Incubator with, dispersing the molecules that composed its body seemingly at random within the volume it had previously occupied.  The other incubator in the room screamed in the place of the predecessor as it dashed over and began nibbling on the body.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P412">“You’re gross, you know that?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P413">And yet you hold a stolen piece of something far more upsetting to most.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P395">“I don’t know <i>what</i> you’re talking about…” she spat, vitriol resting on her tongue as she fiddled with her soul gem.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P395">The Incubator gave her a curious head-tilt, eyes gleaming with anticipation.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P413">When are you going to tell Akemi Homura what you stole from her? </div>
<p class="paragraph-P414">Cassandra’s face twitched involuntarily.  Resentment settled on her tongue as she ran her fingers through her hair.  A <i>bad habit</i> she picked up when she <i>liberated</i> part of the esteemed <i>First Executive.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P414">“When it won’t kill her.  And not a moment beforehand.”</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P415">August knew the demons were getting closer, even if the sound of their destruction was inaudible over her own breathing.  A blinding light blossomed in the stairwell, before a cloud of debris blocked it off to her, her stomach welling with dread.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P415">Not a train was listed on the timetable for the station, realizing with horror as she entered one of the stations with damaged tracks.  There wouldn’t<i> be</i> any trains, she realized,<i> </i>as the station lighting began to flicker.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P415">With a lurch, one of the demons materialized through the wall, heading for her with a lumbering, unpercieving glare.  It was headed right for her. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P416">She went through her options methodically, still rushing.  No other choice to stay calm, and she was beginning to freak out, her pulse throbbing in her ears.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P417">The exit stars are blocked. The power is flickering so the elevator is no option.  No trains, but they don’t seem to be able to go through that much solid earth… so the tunnels maybe?  Not like I have other options as-is. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P417">I have to go into the tunnels.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P418">August grunted as she staggered to her feet, fumbling through her bag for a flashlight, procuring it in an instant.  She stumbled down the platform over the spot where the Incubator had so abruptly left, mid-scream, as she struggled the safety gate at the end of the platform.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P418">“Stupid gate…” she mumbled, hurdling her leg over the gate with panic.   She struggled slightly, landing on the steps behind the safety barrier, pulling the flashlight back out as she marched expediently into the dark, her breath frantic.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P419">Stupid demons.  Stupid Incubators.  Stupid stupid stupid…</p>
<p class="paragraph-P420">August continued onwards, her hand brushing into the walls of the tunnel occasionally, bracing herself against the narrow walkway.  If not for the demon attack, she suspected the power to the train tracks would be on, acting as though they were.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P420">As the subway tunnel sloped downwards gently, August could have sworn the texture of the walls was changing too.  Pausing for a moment, she closed her eyes to focus.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P421">Either my heart is beating way slower than I thought it was, or the tunnels… are beating like a heart.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P422">Each footstep took her deeper into the tunnel network, and further from the disturbing Incubator conversation.  Lost in thought, she felt her foot plunge about 25 centimeters off a small slope, yelping in the process.  As she inspected her clothing, she found her sweater caked in dirt kicked up from her floundering.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P423">So much for keeping it clean…  I hope this thing washes well.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P422">As she brushed the debris off, she realized in a moment she wasn’t hearing demons anymore, and couldn’t see them.  More worryingly though, she wasn’t seeing <i>any</i> sign of the tunnel she had just been in.  The paths behind her seems to converge to nothing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P423">Great, the tunnels themselves are cursed.  Maybe it’s all magic and I’m just gonna die here…</p>
<p class="paragraph-P424">She kept walking, no other choice but to keep moving forward.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P425">If only I had some string to mark the path, this stupid labyrinth playing tricks on me.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P426">Each step brought her closer to escape, or death.<i>  Maybe that’s another kind of escape too! </i> The cadence had become rhythmic, familiar. As her footfall found itself on carpet instead of the damp soil underfoot, she nearly tripped, the transition strange as she found herself staring at… clothes.  Dresses, skirts, suits, jumpers, the works.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P427">Inexplicably, she was in a closet of some kind.  As much as she’d ascribe malice to the universe itself, she couldn’t ignore how<i> utterly absurd</i> a closet attached to a subway tunnel full of luxurious clothing from a myriad of time periods was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P427">She crept forwards, brushing the cardigans aside, and dodging past the winter coats.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P428">With a quick motion, she extinguished her flashlight, holding her bag steady as to not make noise.  Through the slats of the closet door, she found herself staring at a bedroom, ornate and spacious.  The furniture present covered in lavish adornments, the carpet and chandelier as much an interloper in this time period as she was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P429">It looks like something out of a historical drama.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P426">She didn’t see anyone at a glance, peering as intently into the bedroom as she dared.  Off to the right she saw an ottoman stool, an armchair, and a reading light, illuminating a small pile of books. Mercifully, no one was seated.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P430">Through a quiet sigh and a careful swing, the door opened and instead of the bedroom she’d seen parts of through the door, as disparate as they were, she found herself in the center of a vast amphitheater.  The expansive room sported an intricate marble floor, embossing of a sun and planets visible as the floor stretched into the distance.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P431">August couldn’t help but shut her eyes quickly. It was all-together too much.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P432">This can’t be real, this can’t be real, it’s gotta be some trick.  It has to be magic, but what magic?  What’s is doing this?  It can’t be the demons, right?  Is it the Incubators somehow?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P433">She opened her eyes to find her feet on plush carpet again, her knee nearly colliding with a small table in front of her, the reading lamp still burning visibly in the muted ambiance of the room.  Double doors to her left remained sealed, and to her right… a canopy bed, light peeking through the top and bottom. August blinked in disbelief as she noticed a girl in the bed looking at her with horror.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P434">The girl in the bed pulled back the canopy quickly, August gasping as she stared at the magical girl in an intricate outfit, blue and white adornments aplenty, her eyes a radiant light blue.  A flowing skirt followed her</p>
<p class="paragraph-P434">“You must be the new girl, June, right?” she asked, her voice smooth, nearly melodic as August processed the words.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P434">“Uh… my name is August, June is my sister.  Who <i>are you?” A</i>ugust beckoned, the magical girl vacantly smiling for a moment, her eyes locked on hers.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P434">“Come on dear, don’t you recognize family?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P435">In a lurch, August was thrown back, the double doors behind her ripping open as she as back into the expansive amphitheater again.  The groan of the demons she’d been running from on the train platform had picked up right where they’d left off, lining the seats of the amphitheater.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P436">She glanced up at the ceiling, finding any semblance of sky an inky darkness, punctuated by light in the smallest of pinpricks.  August looked around wildly, hoping she’d see her sister, Karina, <i>any magical girl.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P437">I won’t die now, surely.  Surely.  Surely someone can help me… Please...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">She rummaged through her bag, hoping, praying for anything that might help.  The demons closest to the entrance she “came in through” gathered their strength, the air humming as they readied another beam volley.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P439">Flashlight, ration bars, water bottle, flare gun, I have nothing that’ll stop them, even a little. I can’t even run… Goddess help me!</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P438">She closed he eyes firmly, her dread, her <i>death</i> all but certain until she heard a cacophonous explosion behind her.  One of the walls of the amphitheater shattered into a cloud of debris, Andrea standing confidently in her magical girl regalia.  Her soul gem gleaming with intensity as she dropped her arms, tension evaporating, a weak smile worn on her face.  Her blue jumpsuit had been replaced with a long skirt, pleated as if to show the surf, a sleeveless top down to her torso, a silver belt holding the outfit together, a gun still holstered off the edge.  Her braided hair remained up, but her eyes were decorated with eye-shadow in the same tone as her eyes.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“Need a hand?” she asked, August sobbing with relief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P440">“Where did you <i>go, </i>you jerk!  I thought you were keeping me safe!” August yelped, the demons firing over Andrea’s head into the tunnel behind her with malice as they both ducked.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P440">“I… I thought I saw someone who could help my mother.” her face guilt-ridden as she procured a barrage of colorful discs of debris, hurling them with intensity at the demons.  Two of them recoiled, one more tripping over the back of the podium seating, as she first-pumped to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P440">“Good to know I still can hit ‘em when it matters.” Andrea said smugly, August starry eyed at the girl before glancing back at the sheer <i>volume</i> of demons.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P440">“<i>Please</i> tell me you have a gun I can use.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P440">“You bet your ass I do!” she beamed, handing the firearm off of her belt to August as she reloaded it, nodding to her peer as they began their barrage.  August squeezed off two shots from the semi-explosive round, the first demon’s head squarely separating from its shoulders as it fell to the ground in a clatter.  The second demon managed to observe the attack in time, and simply opened a hole in space where its head had been moments prior.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P441">Andrea grinned as she send two gravel pucks through the demons torso, collapsing with the same gravity as August’s kill.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P441">“Looks like you’re a good shot too.” she said to August.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P441">“Harmony gave me a crash course earlier.” August murmured as she reloaded, purely for dramatic effect with the firing mode the gun was in.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P441">“Listen, magical girls are a family affair.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P441">“I mean. That’s what the Incubator implied when it was trying to up-sell me on magical girl stuff…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P441">“So it <i>is trying </i>to contract you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P441">“Yeah…” August said plainly, firing off another few rounds as she thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P441">“Though it did say something about my wish letting me be a goddess.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P442">Andrea paused for a moment, rattled from the comment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P442">“You’re <i>sure</i> that’s what it said?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P442">“Very.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P443">Andrea’s face was cast in shadow as she was amidst a torrent of thoughts. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P444">What are the Incubators planning?  Why are they trying to contract her so badly?  Why did they break their own rules about suggesting wishes?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P445">She shuddered, choosing instead to launch a barrage of rubble from underneath her at the nearest demon, the beam vaporizing it mid-flight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P446">“Andrea, wait-” August asked quickly, worry in her voice obvious as she connected the patterns, lacey edges, and frills of the outfit she was staring at with the one of the girl resting in the bedroom, somewhere both here and not.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P440">“Is your mom a magical girl too?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">Andrea paused in an instant, two demons shattering into grief cubes in the distance as their peers attempted to close the gap left by the death.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“Why?” she spat, more clay projectiles ripped from the floor beneath them as she whirled them around her head as if by shot-put, the heads of three demons severed plainly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“Because before I was here in… whatever this is-” gesturing upwards and around her with incredulity.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“Before, I was in a bedroom with a girl in an outfit that looked really similar to yours.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“Her name is Itsumi…” Andrea whispered, her voice barely audible under the barrage of clay pigeons, four more demons decaying into grief cubes as she glanced back at August.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“Wait just a bit, okay?” she exclaimed, leaping over the edge of the pit into the seating, narrowly dodging two demons as she grabbed the grief cubes, before leaping towards August, skidding across the floor with grace before launching clay pigeons at them, an energy beam hitting them mid-air as their frames collapsed into bitrot, grief cubes revealed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“How’d<i> </i>you get there?  Please.” Andrea asked, practically beckoning, her eyes shining with intensity as August winced.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">“I don’t know!  I blinked when I was in the tunnels, and then I was there, and she knew my name, and it was freaky and she said I was family, and then kicked me back, I think, but I don’t know how?  I don’t know. I don’t know!”  August was babbling, tears forming in her eyes, rolling off of her beet-red cheeks and onto the soil beneath them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P447">Andrea glanced up, realizing that the demon spawns in the area were, pretty handily, dead.  As long as she got the grief cubes collected, it’d be fine.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P448">With an open embrace, the magical girl hugged August, “Hey… it’s okay.” Andrea smiled, pulling back to look at her.  “I’ll keep you safe.  Besides, you’ve got a lot of people trying to do the same for you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P449">August sniffled, thoroughly overwhelmed still, worry on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P450">“Andrea… why do you need to see your mother so bad?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P450">“She’s very sick… and it’s something I think I need to do alone.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P450">“I’ll come with you, you’ve got a crow to deliver, right?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P451">“I’d honestly prefer if <i>you</i> didn’t come with.  Her knowing your name is already a bit odd…  And in the past, <i>anyone</i> who visited her… came back ill.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P451">“Ill?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P451">“Their minds were fragmented, all because of that damned telepath.  Nobody has been able to see her for months and survived… until <i>you</i>.  I visited her and it made me the same girl I was the day I contracted…” she said, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P451">“Now look who’s babbling!” she chortled, August snorting through her tears, wiping them off with the dirty sleeves of her sweater.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P452">“Heh…” August mumbled, her eyes growing wide as she processed what the girl said.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P452">“It broke them…?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P453">The magical girl had nothing else she could say, her eyes downcast as August look at her, her body racked with anguish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P454">“Why wasn’t I effected though?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P455">Andrea’s voice was barely a whisper, still despondent over those that her mother broke by sheer proximity.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P456">“I don’t know.  I really don’t, but you’re not even a magical girl, so it <i>must be okay somehow.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P457">August watched the magical girl’s face as she picked her head up, face welling with the smallest piece of hope she could muster.  She pocketed the grief cubes nearby as she smiled back at August, taking her hand.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P457">“Do whatever you did before.  Lead the way.” 
</p>
<p class="paragraph-P458">August glanced around at the empty amphitheater, sunlight streaming in from the myriad holes in the roof from the damage as she tried to position herself where she had been before.  Shuffling her feet carefully, aligning herself in the cavern with as much grace as the grime-covered girl could manage.  She hoped, more than anything, that it worked.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P459">She paused for a moment, staring through the open air as she saw a shimmer, the <i>faintest</i> of distortions in front of her, about two feet.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P458">“There’s no place like home…” she mumbled, her eyes slamming shut as she felt wind rush around her, walking forward, and suddenly the room was much smaller.</div>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P460">As the room rushed around them, August realized that the canopy cast stars on the ceiling of the room, a lamp inside projecting the silhouettes of stars and planets.  It was delightfully archaic, but she only had a moment to look to the stars before her eyes were drawn elsewhere.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P460">Andrea’s stance in an instant collapsed, the bravado used moments prior to defeat a gauntlet of demons, gone, just a young girl again.  Her mother was asleep.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P460">She wasn’t looking at her mother.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P460">August’s jaw was agape, staring intently at the floor on the far side of the bed.  She hadn’t had a chance to explore that much when she was here before being so abruptly spat into the arena.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P460">She was staring at <i>bodies</i>.  The bodies of two young girls, very similar in appearance.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P460">Andrea’s body was shaking with guilt, muttering to herself the barely audible.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P460">“I should have known when you didn’t show up to patrols… I’m so sorry…”  tears cascaded down her face, her blue apron stained with teardrops as she ran her fingers to the back of her head shakily, letting her hair down, the braid unraveling itself slowly but surely as the tears continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P460">August couldn’t help but watch, frozen with fear as she realized the likely outcome.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">Itsumi killed them.  Their bodies are here, they’re magical girls.  Their soul gems… aren’t.  Itsumi shattered them.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P462">The same thought was clearly running rampant in Andrea’s mind as the crying grew haggard.  August slowly stepped forward, as if to offer consolation, the doors to the bedroom ripped open.  August spun around to find herself staring at a raven-haired girl, a shield strapped to her arm, a glittering purple soul gem gleaming on her hand.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P462">Homura leapt for August, the sound of breaking glass at the bedside.  An enormous wind behind them hit as though a wall, the two blown through the doors of the bedroom and back into the open chamber as they watched the doors crumble to dust.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P463">Staring up at the horrors, August cowered as the girl next to her stood steadfast.  Where the bedroom would have been was a figure, stories tall, made of shrapnel and barbed wire, two glowing-hot embers where eyes should have been.  Instead of legs, it had a marble-like plinth, a torso made from the same jagged stones supporting it.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P463">The fragments of an abdomen comprised of a myriad of colors of what seemed like glass, lights cast from where a beating heart ‘ought to be and dancing around the room with glee.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P464">Andrea had become a witch.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P465">August couldn’t help but gasp as the dust settled for a moment, finding herself staring at a magical girl, perhaps one of <i>the most famous</i> ever.  Homura.  <i>The</i> Mitakihara Four member.  The <i>First Executive.</i> And… dead for twenty years, give or take a few months.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P466">While the word in back-chatter was that she was still alive, a sighting scattered across Governance colonized worlds, the last <i>confirmed </i>time anyone had seen her was New Athens.  It was <i>unbelievable </i>that she was here, on Galileo, standing there as though she was just… some <i>girl.</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P467">“You’re Akemi Homura….” she said, breathless as the girl gave her a nervous look in response.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P467">“Who <i>are you​?  </i>H-How do <i>you</i> know my name<i>?” </i>the floundering accompanied by a genuine look of worry on her face.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P467">She reached into her shield and pulled out a pair of red glasses, putting them on her face as she glanced up at the behemoth towering over them, a misshapen homunculus of glass and wire.  In an instant, Homura shoved August out of the way, a rain of jagged shards careening towards them, chimes of some kind discordant in the distance.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P467">“Augh!” August yelled, rolling onto her belly before struggling to her feet.  Homura, already upright, reached into her shield for a gun and found herself empty-handed.  Her eyes rattled with disbelief as she pulled out a golf club, a stick, a baton, but no gun.  She groaned to herself, August reaching into her bag to pull something out.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P467">“Here.” August said, holding the gun by the barrel and offering it to the magical girl with decades of experience.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P467">“You’re a better shot than me I’d hope, so… please help me?” she admitted sheepishly, as Homura took the gun in a slight blush, already glancing up at her enemy as she reloaded the gun, a small whine audible as it charged.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P467">“Thank you.” she smiled, before her stern look returned, aimed upwards at the sharp-edged witch.  She careened towards the outer edge of the amphitheater, trying to draw fire as the witch send careening strands of jagged towards the girl.  The sound of shattering glass continued as she ran to outpace the barrage as best she could, as a blue shard sliced through her leg, Homura wailing in pain.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P468">August ran towards her as she tried to pick the magical girl up off the ground.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“Come on!  We <i>need </i>to get out of here!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">Homura looked at her in disbelief, as she realized she was trying to c<i>arry her.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“What are you <i>doing?</i>  Let me get up!  I can walk, I promise!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“NO!” August bellowed, the girl looking at her with a weary look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“You’re just like her...” she muttered, summoning her shield as she unlocked it, the debris from the glass shards suspended mid-air, a jittery frozen hue overcoming everything in the arena, spare the two of them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">What the…” August muttered, putting the girl down with a groan, Homura fell back to the ground in a dusty pile, August frozen mid-air.  With a quick grab of her wrist, August unfroze.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P469">“I can stop time, but I can’t beat this witch as-is. This small gun isn’t going to be enough.” she said confidently, glancing down at the gun she’d so earnestly been offered.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P470">One gun and one of me isn’t enough to beat a witch I’ve never seen before.  I need to re-group and get supplies.  Surely there’s a yakuza safehouse nearby.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P471">August nodded frantically at the realization they were outclassed, and would likely have been joining the girls on the floor if not for the timestop.  Homura was was still <i>by far</i> the combat expert, even in this state, glancing over her shoulder at the figure in the center of the expansive room.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P472">Still, it’s odd she got hurt… She’s done so much more, and she was always depicted as so cool.  And what the hell is a witch?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P469">“Do you have anything to stop the bleeding?” Homura asked nervously, glancing down at the pool of blood forming in the dirt beneath her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“Surely you can heal-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“I’m not…” she began, trailing off as she realized how little she really remembered of her past.  She was in Mitakihara, at the mall with… someone.  And then she was <i>here</i>, in this place.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“Sorry.  I was thinking of an old friend.  I can heal a little, I’m not very good at it, and I’m out of grief seeds...” she mumbled, August taking off her undershirt to use as a wrap, using it to wipe down Homura’s leg as she began her healing, slowly but surely.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“What’s your name?” Homura asked, gritting her teeth as the open wound on her leg pulled itself shut, a teardrop of blood following the seam as it slowly closed, each centimeter further bringing palpable relief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“August.  August Kisaki.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">The magical girl pushed her glasses back up her face with the back of her hand, August giving her a confused look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“You never wore glasses in the movie…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“In the <i>what now?”</i> she jumped, wincing as her healing paused and August laughed a little.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“Come on, you can’t have been <i>that</i> off the grid after New Athens.  Surely you know they made a movie about you, Mami-san, Kyouko-san, Yuma-san.  The<i> Mitakihara Four</i>!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">Homura looked at the girl as if she had two heads, or none at all.  She imagined that getting told she got an adoption offer would feel about the same, equally as impossible. Then again, that was before, not now; before… everything happened.  Before <i>Walpurgisnacht.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P473">I cannot tell her that the movie is titled “Akemi”.  Whatever happened, this girl is clearly not the same as the one everyone think so highly of.   How though, how is she here?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“A movie… about magical girls?  But, the secret! We can’t-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P474">Maybe she hurt her head?  Maybe that’s why she needs the glasses?  No, she’d have used magic to fix them, surely.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“What year do you think it <i>is?</i>  Humankind has known about magic since the Contact War.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">“Contact… War?” Homura mumbled, cradling her head as the headache began to envelop her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P475">No, no… I became a magical girl for someone.  Someone… I care about.  Where the heck-- </p>
<p class="paragraph-P476">August reached down to pull the girl to her feet, Homura gingerly leaned on her, one uncertain step after the other, stumbled towards the tunnels, towards the <i>exit.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P476">“How are you doing on grief cubes?” August asked through gritted teeth, Homura looking at her own hand, and then at August’s in disbelief as she gasped slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P476">“You’re <i>not </i>a magical girl.  But then-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P476">“My sister contracted a day ago.  And…” she muttered, glancing back at the towering entity in the distance, “<i>she</i> was a magical girl too.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P476">“I’m going to let go of you now, so I can get the grief cubes.  I’ll be back in what’s a moment for you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P477">August nodded, before muttering to herself.  <i>Grief </i><i>cubes</i><i>?  </i><i>Didn’t she say grief seeds earlier?  What are those?</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P478">Homura let go of August’s hand as she walked over, picking up three grief cubes from the edge of the stands.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P479">It’s not a grief seed, but it’ll work the same, right?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P478">A burden lifted off of her as her murky soul gem, that prismatic diamond she’d spent too much time looking at, as she watched the accumulated grief seep out of it and into the small cuboids, taking on the same hue she became disconcertingly familiar with.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P477">As she braced herself against the hand-railing, she found herself back at August, realizing they could <i>probably </i>get out of the labyrinth safely if she stopped using time-stop.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P477">With a lurch, she ended the time-stop, August jumping as the girl suddenly “appeared” across from her, descending the small staircase next to the entryway.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P476">The girls gave each other weary looks and turned towards the exit, <i>both</i> hearing a familiar voice as an unwelcome face emerged from the shadows.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P480">Akemi Homura.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">The girl winced as she spun her head around, looking for the source of the voice, pain shooting up her frail body.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Kyubey! What are you-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P481">I am not the Incubator known by that name.  Why are you not using the name you so intentionally use for my species?</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“I don’t-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P481">Do you not feel it, Akemi Homura?  You once described this miasma with familiarity.  We have not had the chance to observe it since your anecdote was recorded approximately four hundred years ago in Mitakihara.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">Homura turned around, looking at the stained glass monstrosity with fear and uncertainty, as she looked back at the Incubator with anguish.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“What do you mean, four <i>hundred </i>years?  I’m <i>fourteen.</i>”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P481">I didn’t think such a thing was possible.  And yet, you appear to behave distinctly than the Homura Akemi that was observed.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Okay I’ve just about had it with you and <i>you—”</i> she opened, looking at August with frustration,<i> “</i>saying I’m <i>acting like someone else</i>.  I’m just… me.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P481">Akemi, we’re in the presence of a witch.  You are, of your own admission, willing to keep fighting.  So fight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P482"><i>A </i>vicious smile on the Incubator’s face drew a disgusting look from Homura, her shield surrendering the gun August had bestowed upon her with impunity.  In an instant, the alien was spread into a fluffy-looking debris field, walking over its guts with a scowl on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P483">“Not today…” she muttered under her breath, August poking at the marshmallow-texture debris for a moment, before her and Homura re-entered the catacombs outside the witch’s labyrinth.</p>
<hr> </hr><p class="paragraph-Text_20_body"> </p><h2 class="paragraph-P484">Chapter (None) - Scene (None) - Spiderweb</h2>
<p class="paragraph-P485">Homura was adrift in her own mind.  A myriad spiderweb of thoughts connected, gossamer lines connecting them.  A pair of red glasses drifted off of her face slowly, before pulling them back, her hair unbraiding itself behind her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P486">Why do I feel like this?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P487">She tried to remember where she was, on a small backwater colony named Galileo, before that… Mitakihara?  But <i>when</i>?  She found the thought confusing, spare a single anchoring memory.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P487">A lurch as her soul gem was formed, the Incubator looming over her, beady red-pink eyes looking through her with the same garish intensity it showed all magical girls.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P487">“-Strong enough to protect her!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P486">Who was she?  Why can’t I remember her?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P487">Homura produced a facsimile of a white void, the same one she’d spent countless hours in in Mitakihara trying to prevent the destruction Walpurgisnacht caused.  And yet, in <i>all </i>of those memories, she couldn’t quite shake the feeling someone was missing.  Lunchtime chats with Tomoe-san and Sayaka-chan, and… someone else?  Arguments with Kyoko as to whether or not to try and save Sayaka-chan from the labrynth.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P488">Homura’s head began to spin again.  The more intently she tried to figure out who it was, the worse the headache became.  She was sure that there was someone else.  She focused on the “empty” seat between her and Sayaka most of the time, and felt as though the space there had been… punctured.  As though the memory had craft scissors taken to it, cut out haphazardly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P488">Ms. Akemi was sure there was someone who she checked up on, shomeone who she swore to never allow to contract.  Someone whose presence felt like rain after months of drought, and would be her reason to contract.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P486">Why can’t I remember her?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P487">Homura twisted around and leapt for the ribbon, floating in the sterile void, a flash of recognition as her fist closed around it, the most sickening grief reducing her to a hoarse, sobbing mess.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P487">And then she was awake, staring at an unfamiliar ceiling, as two girls in the distance pratted on about the right way to make a cake.</p>
