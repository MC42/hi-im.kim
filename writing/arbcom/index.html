<div class="paragraph-P3"> "It is nice to know that the universe is self‐consistent enough to handle a few small exploits, a few violations of its laws here and there, without falling apart entirely. After all, when you have all of reality to run, what's a few ontological paradoxes among friends?"</div>
<p class="paragraph-P5">---§---</p>
<p class="paragraph-P3">“The complete disappearance of the Galileo-µ colony is a tragedy of enormous significance.  Despite the resounding effects of the scenario encountered in Kepler-37, our best and brightest cannot conclusively establish a root cause for the colony’s disappearing act.  While quite a few suspect it was wormhole-related, and some would attribute it to the instability of the entire sector, some <i>better informed </i>as of late suspect it had something to do with a wish.” </p>

<div class="paragraph-P6">August was no stranger to the sound of gunfire, after all, it’d been her alarm clock for <span>what f</span><span>elt like</span> years.  Staring blurry-eyed at the horizon, she found exactly what she expected, <span>quietly resigned at the unarguable reality.  Staring back at her was a</span>n inky-black sky, not a single <span>star in sight.  Through gritted teeth, she shook her sister, June, awake, the girl bleary-eyed and squinting through the dust-filled air.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P7">“Is it morning…?” June mumbled, her curly mop of hair threatening to obscure her vision.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P7">“<span>Something like that.  C’mon.” August smiled back, her </span><span>glasses </span><span>hiding the bags under her eyes as well as any could.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P8">The two of them snuck through the debris field as carefully as they could, their gray coveralls the same color as the rubble.  Methodical steps, one after the other, took them through the collapsed surroundings.  They couldn’t afford the bravado that others their age might’ve, and were significantly more fragile, even with the myriad of implants and upgrades that percolated to the outer colonies.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P9">August grasped at the edge of a streetlight, knowing based on the shape of the dome that they found a subway entrance.  Despite the lack of other obvious signage, she figured it was as clear a sign as they’d get.  If they could sneak through the entrance, they’d be able to get somewhere safe, to maybe find loved ones.  August hoped desperately that Galileo survived.  All they had to do was wait for the train.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P10">As August climbed past concrete boulders, alloy reinforcements still jutting through the wreckage like barbs, she didn’t once let go of June’s hand.  They were safer together, after all, despite the occasional mis-step.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P11">The stairs to the station were utterly charred, <span>detonated</span> explosives spalling the concrete, <span>th</span><span>e damage </span><span>only </span><span>waning </span><span>once they descended the final stairwell onto the platform itself.  </span><span>It seemed that, despite the efforts of </span><span>the Ceph</span><span>, </span><span>this station had survived intact, and in fairly good shape, dust notwithstanding.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P11">The tunnels that cross-connected the planet were carved from the rock-face, stitches beneath the surface, struggling to keep the world together.  The speed of the trains traversing them left a hollow wind sweeping through the station, a constant breeze keeping them company while they waited.  While a station normally had platform gates, any that might’ve been present were removed in the days and months after the world vanished.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P12">August had ridden the train with her parents enough to know about the wind, June too young to remember it as anything more than a dream.  A dream from when stars still shone in the sky.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P13">June couldn’t help but shudder in the wind, colder for it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P14">“I don’t like this…”  June murmured, her sister squeezing her hand tighter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P15">“Me neither Juney, but you gotta be strong, okay?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P15">“Easy for you to say!  You’re older!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P16">August couldn’t help but laugh a little.  “I may be older but that doesn’t make it easier.” neglecting to continue the thought<i>.  Besides.  At least you don’t have to remember Mom and Dad so vividly.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P17">As she stood on the platform, hoping that June couldn’t see her face through her own hair tossed in the wind, she heard the gentle rumble of the train in the distance.  The tunnel walls echoed, making every interaction of the track and wheel resonate as if a drum, as August heard the carriage begin deceleration in the distance.  The tracks sung in harmony with the speed of the car as the brakes “plucked” their guides, forming a steel alloy guitar string hundreds of kilometers long.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P18">Through distorted speakers, the automated announcement system spat out in Standard a crackling, crunching message, distorted through what must’ve been damaged speakers.  “This is an Express, Pink Line Train to New Florence.  First stop will be, Chapel Hill.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P19">The girls got on, their worn sneakers crossing from the weathered concrete into the comparatively pristine carriage, dust settling in their footsteps.  It wasn’t hard to find a seat, the train deserted spare them, every seat an option.  As the doors sealed with a pleasant chime, the lighting inside the carriage flickering slightly as the motors hummed to life.  With a lurch, and then the discordant tone of the motors accelerating, their train careened through the dark towards New Florence.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P20">As the carriage continued its feverish pace into the subterranean void, rocking gently on the tracks, June couldn’t help but nod off.  It was the most comfortable place they’d been in weeks, and it had <i>HVAC</i>.  August reached into her knapsack and pulled out a water bottle, the seal of her parents’ workplace still emblazoned on the bottom, corroding in the uncontrolled ecosystem.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P20">Still, as far as August was concerned, this was luxury.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P21">I hope that things are better in New Florence.  Maybe they’ll use words and not gunfire.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P22">As she stared through the discolored front window of the carriage, she found herself staring at a bullethole she hadn’t noticed in the station, aimed up towards the ceiling.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P23"><i>Or at least, </i><i>not</i><i> </i><i>exclusively gunfire</i>, August silently prayed to no one in particular.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P25">“We could go back for Galileo, they <i>are</i> the colony’s namesake.   Could encourage their<i> peers</i> to cooperate.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P25">“Galileo retired, boss.  Like, a bit before we got sent into this hellhole.  We don’t need to get ‘em.  As far as their peers are concerned, they’re probably dead anyways.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P26">The girl paused for a moment, fidgeting with a ring on her finger, hoping that her subordinates wouldn’t notice.  If they <i>did</i>, she’d deal with it with the only tools she had left; force.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P25">“Fine.  But you better check in a week or two if the datacenter is <i>fully</i> destroyed.  Last thing we need is someone to <span>s</span><span>pread rumors</span>, <i>especially</i><span> </span><span>some spread by</span><span> Governance sentient</span><span>s</span><span>.</span>”</div>

<div class="paragraph-P27">A pleasant chime woke August up, and <span>she found the point of a </span>spear <span>hovering centimeters from her nose.  A spear held still by a</span> girl in a frilly costume, <span>looking slightly</span><span> older than August.</span>  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P28">A magical girl.  Of course.  This is MSY territory, or… Church territory?  Is there a difference?</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P29">“Who <i>are</i> you?” <span>the girl ba</span><span>r</span><span>ked, her hair kept neatly in twin ponytails, a pale orange skirt matching </span><span>the ends of her hair, her </span><span>eyes </span><span>a deeper amber</span><span>, and of course, her </span><i>soul gem </i><span>shone in the same shade</span><span>.  </span><span>The girl</span><span> was trying her best to be threatening, but, August was still </span><i>slightly taller</i><span>, despite the mage’s heels.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P29">“Uh.  I’m August-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P29">“Wrong question I guess.  Why are you <i>here.</i>” she demanded, August wearily standing her ground as June shrunk behind her slightly.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P29">“<span>Safety</span> hopefully. We grew up on the outskirts of Bergen, which-”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P29">“Was destroyed in the Ceph attack...” the magical girl finished, her spear dissolving as easily as she’d summoned it.  Her posture faltered for a moment, staring past the girls into the interior of the carriage, August realizing suddenly there were two more magical girls on the outside of the carriage.  A glance to the front of the train found her staring at a nervous rail system worker, the older man holding an override button at the staff gate towards the end of the station.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P29">“<span>We’ve been trying to get to somewhere safe, and a few folks we found on the outskirts point</span><span>ed</span><span> us in the right direction, most of the other train </span><span>stations were closed though</span><span>, so we had to go on foot until we… got here I guess.”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P30">Through a silent and exasperated sigh, the magical girl around and walked out of the car, waving the two girls standing guard to follow her.  The mechanical operator released the hold button, the traincar slowly rolling to the next stop.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P31">Isn’t <span>waving th</span><span>ose magical girls to follow</span><span> on</span> a little superfluous?  They can telepathically talk, right..?</div>
<p class="paragraph-P32">As they ascended the stairs, their once-aggressor pulled out a keyring from an unseen pocket of her skirt, methodically opening a door labeled “Staff Only | D&amp;E” with the twist of a key, descending into what August <i>hoped </i>was just a maintenance pathway.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">As August turned the corner of the catwalk, June turned around to look at the open door, the two guards looking at her with the faintest hints of pity as the door closed, the lock clicking shut behind them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P33">They snaked their way through back tunnels, walkways barely tall enough for them, girders and spans decaying slightly in the environment less controlled as some of it revealed sunlight, cascading down the practically incandescent cavern walls, the red bouncing back up off the floor, casting distorted shadows on the far wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“So uh-” August started, the girl in front of her not acknowledging her talking.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“Where are we going?” she asked, the wall as responsive as their escort, before finally responding.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“Somewhere safe.” the magical girl said in a defeated tone.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“I thought all of New Florence <i>wa</i>s safe?” August cautiously raised, the girl’s posture deflating slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P32">“It is!” she snipped, continuing before her<i> companions </i>had a chance to respond.  <i> “</i>Or rather… it <i>was</i> like that.  For a while anyways.  We can’t just take in every single sob-story that comes our way.  Some want to hurt others.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P34">Even June couldn’t ignore the undertones, the barely-veiled threat.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P35">Others who we took mercy on betrayed us.  Don’t make the same mistake.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P36">The silence hung heavy in the air, punctuated largely by the pipework, the crunch of gravel under foot, and winces as they ducked and weaved through the maze of tunnels.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P37">June was tired of the rattle of pipes and the arrhythmic thud of footsteps being the only sounds in the air, and decided to test their <i>guide</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P37">“Why is this place so old?  It feels like something ancient, something <i>cursed</i>.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P38">The magical girl turned to face them as she responded, almost taking pride in the knowledge.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P39">“You’re a smart kid, ya know?  It’s older than you’d think.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P40">June couldn’t help but smile before the orange-hued girl continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P39"> “New Florence is like old Florence in that way.  Layers on layers, y’know?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P41">“Uh… no.” June mumbled, her smile mired by confusion, hoping the pretty lady wouldn’t mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P41">August realized with an all-too-embarrassing epiphany that the magical girl was distrustful of them because she just had <i>nothing to go on.</i>  They were all too on edge.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P38">After what felt like an eternity, and several dozen more turns, their escort was the one to open a conversation, a proverbial white flag in their cold war of sulking.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P42">“It’s only fair you know where we’re going, I <i>did hold you at spear-point, </i><i>after all.</i><i>” </i>the magical girl admitted, hoping they’d take the hint.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P38">“Hmpf.” June responded, August trying to shrug it off on her behalf.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P43">I earned that one I guess.  Nobody here takes kindly to being woken up at weapon-range.  Still, had to be careful.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P42">“I’m taking you through the tunnels to MSY District.  You said you were running, do you have family here?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P44">“Uh… kinda?  We were adopted in <i>Nova Si</i><i>c</i><i>ilia </i>by the Kisakis but…” August trailed off, catching the gaze of the magical girl, her eyes dimly glowing in the dark, amber gems in the unrelenting void.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">She didn’t need to finish the sentence, the guilt weighed on her enough that she visibly deflated as the sentence trailed off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P46">“Okay.” their guide mused, expecting something of the sort.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P47">The trio exited a door through another locked doorway, finding themselves in a sterile, but <i>human friendly </i>hallway.  A far cry from the proto-catacombs they’d been in just prior, August couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P48">“For the time being then, you’re staying with me.” she smiled, the door at the end of the hallway unlocking and opening itself.  As August and June passed the doorframe, they couldn’t help but read the names on the door. “Karina &amp; Shannon Luhr” was written in both Human Standard and Japanese, kanji clearly added by hand.   June trying to hide a smile at the handwriting, her face washed over with awe as she entered the home.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P49">They saw a well-used kitchen, plush couches in a sprawling living room through a serving window.  One of the couches was overflowing with all sorts of plush animals.  Karina briefly mentioned the multiple private bedrooms, guest rooms, tall ceilings, and a <i>dedicated study</i>.  The Luhr household was luxurious by most standards, but August was most surprised by the <i>food.</i>  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P49">She had spices, and flours, all sorts of luxury goods, cooking supplies from before the collapse, stuff that was practically <i>unheard of </i>on this rock.  Saffron, jasmine, spices and liquors, the collection one that’d have caused wars a few hundred years prior.  Instead, August and June found them just <i>sitting </i>in neatly organized containers, <i>begging</i> to be used.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P50">It felt like a <i>home, </i>not just a house.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Excuse me, miss magical girl?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Mhmm, June, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P51">The girl nodded excitedly, the magical girl a celebrity to her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“June, please call me Karina.” their host inexplicably placid.   She fiddled with a black and silver overcoat, utterly useless for a magical girl like her, tucking it into the nearby closet as she walked down the hall.  Moving past the entryway, she strayed into her living room, sitting down in an armchair methodically.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Miss Karina, can my sister make you some food?  She’s a really good cook!” June smiled, the charm turned to eleven for their savior of the hour.  Karina’s stomach couldn’t help but rumble.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P45">“Hey!” August balked, “you could have <i>asked </i>if I wanted to<i> </i>first…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P52">June could help but shrug, “You’d never say no to that… didn’t think I needed to!”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P53"><span>“</span><span>Oh, that’s not </span><span>necess</span>—<span>” Karina balked.  </span><i>There’s no way to tell them I practically eat garbage most of the time.  That this is my wife’s house more than my own.  T</i><i>hat she might </i><i>not</i><i>-</i></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P54">“Are you <i>sure,</i> Luhr-sama?  It’d be no trouble at all, especially since you’re going through the trouble of hosting us.  Please.” August beckoned, the tension rising until the<span>ir host’s polite posturing collapsed.</span><span>  She was </span><i>spent.</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P55">“Fine!  Fine.  You can cook whatever you want for yourselves, and if there’s leftovers I’ll happily take them.”  She couldn’t help but smile, the girls practically<i> ecstatic</i> at the opportunity.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P56">“I still get food from the Church <span>or work</span> most of the time, <span>rations or prepped meals are far more </span><span>efficient</span><span>. Don</span><span>’t worry if you’re too hungry to leave something for me.  I promise it’s okay.</span>” <span>she beamed, hoping they got the message </span><span>she was trying to lay out.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P57">August couldn’t help but notice the emphasis on the word “Church”, distinct over the generic of a chapel; August refused to make a face as Karina was still in deep thought over the expected kitchen antics, trying to remember where the cleaning supplies were.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P58">No matter how bad it is, I’ll eat it.  Goddess knows I’ve made worse for Shannon, and eaten worse in combat.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P54">“Thank you, Ms. Karina!” June giddily balked, as Mrs. Luhr found herself nursing a headache.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P54">“I’m going to lay down for a bit." she mumbled, her face obscuring her head as she gingerly got to her feet, using the wall as a guide as she slowly ascended the steps to the half-landing.  “There’s clothes in the bedroom next to mine, something should fit both of you, toss your laundry in the hamper next to the bathroom.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P54">“Thank you again, Luhr-sama!” August and June said in unison, looking at the kitchen’s pantry with glee, August pulling out an actual<i> paper and ink cookbook</i><i> </i>as Karina collapsed into bed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P59">Goddess-damnit.  Why do I keep taking in strays? </p>
<p class="paragraph-P60">She pulled open a drawer and pulled out grief cubes, her soul gem murky.  Such was the cost of navigating the maze of tunnels under the city.  She’d paid that penalty more than once, but this much depletion was <i>sloppy,</i> even by her <i>admittedly</i> waning standards.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P59">Know the enemy, keep it together.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P61">Karina woke to the smell of bread.  Actual bread, made the old fashioned way.  She had more than her fair share of allocs between her magical girl dispensation and Shannon’s in their shared account, but having the <i>time</i> to go and get fresh food when visiting was never really an option.  Shannon loved to surprise her, jams and breads, rolls and sandwiches.  Actual <i>non-synthesized, </i><i>handmade</i> food.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P61">As she swung her bedroom door open, she found August and June happily plodding along in the kitchen.  Two rolls of something brilliantly aromatic sat on the counter, split open already with June happily devouring a sandwich, August enjoying some toast of some kind, preserves spread across the surface.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P61">“How long was I out?” she asked, her internal chronometer happily spitting out an answer of <i>17 hours, three minutes.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P62">“It’s about mid-day so, probably like fifteen, sixteen hours?” August said, her affect a little more cheery than it had been the day before. Finally able to relax a little.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P62">“Ouch, guess I was more stressed than I thought.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P62">“I mean, who <i>wouldn’t </i>be, finding two vagrant children on a train that might’ve been a bomb or something.” August joked, a smile creeping in.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P62">“Ouch, rude!” Karina smiled back, taking it all in jest.  She had to.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">After a moment, and grabbing a slice of the bread, she nibbled on it absentmindedly for a while.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P64">It’s good.  The herbs and butter, crunch and give.  It’s delicious.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">She was so thrown off she almost didn’t notice the girls watching her enjoy the fruits of their labor, hoping so much it’d be taken well.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P65">“You two sleep okay?” Karina mumbled, bread still in her mouth as she relished the novelty.   Still easier to get than the synthesized equivalent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P65">“I slept like a rock…” August chirped, June groaning slightly.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P65">“<span>I had… weird dreams.  Bleh.” </span><span>June groused</span><span>, </span><span>knowing full well how childish it made her look</span><span>.  She didn’t </span><i>care.</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P65">“How so?” Karina asked, knowing full well she had nightmares too, and hoping she hadn’t given any to the kids.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P65">“Uh… there was a cat, I think?  Gunfire.  A bunch of people screaming.  And then something so big it made the sun go dark.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P66">August’s grip faltered, her sandwich slipping, if for a moment, catching it right before it hit the counter.  <i>A dream like that sounded more like…</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P67">August’s reaction caught Karina off-guard, but she was determined to not show it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P68">It was almost as if she knows how this works.  Better than she should.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“I-…  I know we got off on the wrong foot yesterday.” Luhr-sama huffed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“What an understatement…” June mumbled, Karina raising her hand slightly to protest, before falling back down.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“I… earned that one.  So, my name is Karina.  This is my home, and my wife’s of course.  I wor-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Where is she?” August asked, Karina’s face tensing at the interruption.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P69">Another uneasy silence later, she continued, careful to not make <i>herself</i> upset.  Last thing she wanted was emotional suppression around kids.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P70">“She… died.  We think.   They’re not sure.” she muttered, her voice so quiet they could barely hear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“I’m so sorry. I-we, didn’t know.” August sputtered, June nodding along intentionally.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Don’t be.  We both signed up for this, y’know?  She was on her way back from Kepler-37, trying to outrun it all and, she wasn’t inside before the teardrop formed.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P71">August couldn’t help but grimace, she’d kept digging and got exactly what she asked for.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P72">June raised her hand as if to answer a question in class, Karina nodding at her, expectantly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P72">“Luhr-sama, uh… how <i>old</i> are you?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P72">“June!  You can’t just <i>ask people that</i>.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P73">“No no, it’s okay.” Karina laughed.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P74">This kid is bold and nosy.  I like that.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P73">“I’m <span>actually </span>twenty-seven.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P72">“Wait, but you look <i>our </i>age.” August said, jaw half-agape.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P72">“Hah, I sure don’t get treated it most of the time!” Karina laughed, a weak smile floating back to the surface.  June and August were <i>disarming</i> in a way she found uncanny.  She checked for magic in the area, and found nothing unexpected.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P75">So they’re not enchanted or something.  Phew. I just got Shannon’s love of kids, which… ugh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P72">“It’s pretty common for magical girls to be older than they look, especially for the really old ones.  They can be older than most grandparents and still look like you or me.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P72">“Whoa…” June said, starry-eyed as August shaking her head briefly as she tried to focus on the tasks occupying her mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“So, what’s the plan for today then?” August asked, Karina finishing her piece of bread before grabbing another.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">Karina contemplated just sending them an itinerary for her day, before realizing for civilians it’d be nearly entirely redacted, even if it was communicable.  Not as useful as just <i>telling them </i><i>verbally</i>, even though she strictly didn’t need to.  Besides, they’re <i>kids.</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P63">“So, I gotta drop you off at the Rehousing Group, talk to Stephanie.  She’s great, and will help you two <span>three hots and a cot, so to speak.  </span><span>Plus, you’ll find out how to </span>get involved locally.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Okay, cool!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Uh, Luhr-sama?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Yes August?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Would it be okay if I went to visit a friend first?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“Of course.  I already set an appointment for you for about four hours from now, so that should give them plenty of time.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">“You’re… just gonna drop us off and then ditch?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P63">She nodded, a weak smile on her face.  “Someone’s gotta do the work still.  We’re not gonna be in here forever.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P76">August took her bag from the floor near the door and slung it over her shoulder, the well-worn vessel pressing dirt and concrete dust into the clean maroon sweater she’d borrowed from Karina’s laundry pile.  She glanced back at the interior of the living space with a hopeful look on her face, before closing the door.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P77">As they left the home, nestled between a stuffed shark and a throw pillow with a cheesy joke on it, a glassy-eyed off-white plush on the couch blinked at the door they’d just left through, and vanished.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P78">The trio found themselves staring at the door that signaled their departure from the sprawling and maze-like underground, another “D&amp;E | Staff Only” sign staring at them while Karina procured her keyring again.</div>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Luhr-sama, can I ask a question?” August piped up, Karina already a dozen steps down the catwalk.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“You already did though, what is it?” the magical girl smiled back, her eyes glowing a dim orange in the relative shade of the tunnel.  Still, the girls unable to ignore how much <i>comfortable </i>she was this trip, despite the maze of the catacombs.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Uh… how <i>is</i> the district doing?  Or like… MSY as a whole here.  Don’t get in trouble or anything but, I want to know how safe my sister is… and you I think.” August rambled, biting her tongue on the last few syllables.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“Yeah, magical girls are the thing that keeps all of us safe, so are <i>you</i> safe?” June prattled off, nearly word-for-word a poster Karina had seen on the inside of some bulkhead a tour or two ago.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P80">I’m alive, but good goddess I want to just sit down and cry.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P81">As June nearly bumped into her, Karina found herself a bit ashamed, reveling in the joy.  If for a moment, she got to forget there was at least <i>one</i> war on.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“So… we’re not doing great.  We met you at the station with an armed patrol, remember?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P82">Karina couldn’t help but reflect.  It felt <i>absurd</i> to hold children up with weapons, but the protocol dictated it, and there <i>was precedent.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P83">August and June nodded in unison as they recalled being woken up at spearpoint.  Rather quickly though, June found herself wearing a confused expression.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“I mean.  It did seem a bit odd though…” June warbled, “aren’t magical girls for big stuff, not just two random girls?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P79">“<span>MSY has</span><span> had </span><span>folks</span><span> show up like you did.  She vaporized a city block in Old City, </span><span>set off a bomb of some kind</span><span>.  Took us weeks to clean up the mess, </span><span>a lot of people died...</span><span>”</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P79">“<span>Oh </span><span>god, </span><span>I’m so sorry, I didn’t-” August began, </span><span>fighting her emotions as best she could.</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P79">“<span>August.  Stop </span><i>apologizing.</i><span>  You had </span><i>no way</i><span> of knowing!  It was classified </span><span>and stuff</span><span>, and as civilians, you don’t </span><i>get </i><i>access</i><i> that </i><i>info</i><i>.</i><span>” </span><span>Karina lamented, August on the verge of tears.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“What happened to not breaking rules?” June pressed, Karina taken aback by how <i>observant</i> the girl was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“I… given the circumstances of, well… everything, we’re a bit short on staff.  We really need<i> anyone </i>we can get,  sorta like a TNC was back in the day.” Karina divulged, August’s melancholy interrupted by the absurdity of it all. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“TNC?” she asked, nose still sniffly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“Trusted Non-Contractees.” Karina responded matter-of-factly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“I thought you <i>didn’t trust us?</i>” June asked, a sour look on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“I don’t.  I mean, not entirely.  Not yet.  You gotta do a background check, but they’ll do that at Rehousing.  We check everyone now, given the circumstances.” Karina added, each addition more rushed than the last.  She didn’t even notice she was distracted until they’d already taken a wrong turn, and was now <i>very</i> confused where they were.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P79">“You didn’t murder me in my sleep, so you’re pretty good in my book.” she smiled, still mired with anxiety at the dizzying labyrinth in front of her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P84">Besides, you’re both contracting age.  If you’ve survived the past few months in this hellscape, you’re clever and intelligent.  We need clever just as much as we do magic right now.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P85">The girls laughed a bit, August unable to stop herself from babbling on “You didn’t hurt us either, so how bad can you <i>really be?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">As Karina stopped dead in her tracks, June and August bumped into her, the girl stumbling as she caught herself on the smooth rockface in front of her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“Glad you trust me a little more, but I think I fucked up.” Karina admitted, the girls’ faces contorted in fear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“I think we’re lost.” Karina mumbled, “I don’t know <i>how</i> but we’re lost.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">August reached into her bag for a flashlight as June picked a large flat rock off the ground, ready to fight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P86">“And I’ve got a feeling someone <i>else</i> is down here with us.” Karina couldn’t help but mumble, so quiet she hoped that her companions wouldn’t hear her.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“<span>Wait,</span><span> how did you get </span><i>lost</i><span>, you seemed like you’ve done this a bunch!”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P87">“I <i>have!</i> But usually I’m alone, or with other magical girls.  Not just two chatty <i>civilians</i>!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P87">“Agh, I don’t like this!” June yelped</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“No shit, Socrates!  Okay, give me a second and just be quiet.  August, turn your torch off.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Why?” August balked, their only source of light in the dark’s beam jittered slightly, following the shaking of her hand.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Magical girl stuff, I swear.  Plus, it helps me focus.” Karina said, August nodding carefully.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Okay…” August gulped, turning the flashlight off and plunging the tunnel into darkness, the environment only illuminated dimly by Karina’s eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">She squeezed her hand with June tighter, the girls nervous.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Okay, we need to go back three intersections, and then up the stairs.  Follow me.” Karina stated absolutely, August flicking the flashlight back to its radiant operation, the warm glow distinct from the amber trickle they’d had moments prior.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Why did you need it<i> dark?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Uh.  Combat stuff lets me see in the dark.  Wider spectra, can even see in the infared.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“<i>Ah.</i>” August nervously swallowed still, the minor shock still making her more on edge, her host already visibly relaxing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“I don’t know how you just… recover so quickly.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Getting lost in tunnels isn’t the hardest thing most magical girls do in a normal week.  Besides, I was practically <i>raised </i>in tunnels like these.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Really?  How?  You must’ve been a kid!  And not like, the one you look now!” June sputtered, clearly trying to understand how the girl before them became a magical girl.  August rolled her eyes a little at the showmanship.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P88">“Uh.  My parents worked for D&amp;E.  I contracted as soon as <span>an </span>Incubator showed up.   <span>T</span>hey got the pamphlet and stuff <span>explaining how it all worked</span>, but they already knew.  Patriotic duty <span>or something</span>.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“D&amp;E?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Delivery and Errands.  Started as a Mitakihara delivery company, then all of Japan, and now they’re mostly a vestige of formality.  Some of the Ancients like to wax poetic and be nostalgic about the old days.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P88">“Oh.” August said.  “I didn’t know it was formed in Mitakihara.  I think one of the ancestors of our parents was from there.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“August, the sooner you learn this the better.  A <i>lot</i> of stuff out here still has ties back to Mitakihara.” Karina huffed, her shoulders tensing as they found themselves at the door they’d been ushered through the day before, “lightly encouraged” at spearpoint.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“And here we are at the station.” Karina announced, distracted by something the girls couldn’t see as she pushed through the turnstile.  “Just stay on the train until it says something about housing or sanctuary.  Both stops get you to Rehousing.” Karina imparted as she turned towards the stairs. August and June watched as the girl transformed in an instant, acknowledging an alert on her TacComp.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Next train is in two minutes.  See you later!   You should be able to get in to my place if anything goes wrong!” she yelled jumping back over the turnstile and sprinting up the stairs, so quickly that she left a cloud of dust as she left.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Wait but I-” August began, Karina already long gone.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“What is it?” June asked, trying to console her sister.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“I wanted to say thank you… and to ask if Galileo was still working in the city center...”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“I thought Galileo was like… a super smart AI.” June piped, relaxing finally that it was her and her big sister again.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Yeah! They are, but… they were always really nice when I needed help with my math homework.” August professed.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P89">“But… I thought that was something Governance Ar-<span>i</span>th-m<span>a-meti-</span>”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P89">“Arithmatic Education.  Yeah AriEd did help a bunch, but… Galileo didn’t make me feel dumb when I messed up...” she mused, reflecting on memories of her digital confidant.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P90">The two girls found themselves in a small but very functional office nestled between a bombed out office complex and a small coffeeshop that <i>somehow</i><span> still had beans.  Not many, mind you, but still.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P90">As they approached the front desk, the lady behind it gestured for them to wait a moment, as she hung up an audio call, hand gesture and all.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P91">“Hi uh… we’re looking for someone named Stephanie?  Uh… Luhr-sama told us you’d be able to get us a place to live.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P91">“Oh, you’re the two kids her patrol found on the train, huh.” she grumbled, her eyes slightly bloodshot as August had a chance to get a closer look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P91">“Yep that’s us!” August nervously laughed, hoping the woman would be able to help them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P91">“Well, <i>I’m </i>Stephanie.  Stephanie Diaz.  So, I’ll be honest, that puta was a bit misleading.  We don’t have <i>all that many</i> residences with open slots.  There’s three in total that are willing, and all of them are at least four person households.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Uh, does that include folks who are deployed or something?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Ordinarily, yes, but… allegedly MSY and the matriarch are in the middle of peace talks.  They expect her to renege on her vow of destruction.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Wait <i>what</i>?” June exclaimed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Yep.” the lady smiled, “we might finally be able to focus on getting out of this little bubble of ours.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Wait, but...-” August began, Stephanie cutting her off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“That means a lot of the deployed staff are expected to return home.  So, unless <i>Karina-chan </i>decides to let you stay, you’d end up in common housing.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P92">“<span>Miss </span>Diaz, <i>please.</i>  Can we just stay with Luhr-sama?  She seemed to like us, I think.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“You think?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“She acted like she had to go do something urgently and like… ran away after transforming.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">Stephanie could help but roll her eyes. “That’s the problem with active duty magical girls, y’know?  Always running off.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Well, we’re not, so we’d be more than happy to provide home-comforts.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Well, there’s at least two things you’d need to do first.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Background check, right!  She said that’d be a thing.” August piped, Stephanie raising a flat palm, trying to get her to slow down.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Yeah.  A MSY enlisted mind-reader will ask you a series of questions to ensure you have no ill intents to get access to anything you shouldn’t.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“I mean… that’s fine.” August nervously responded, June all the more annoyed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Why‽ it’s a house!  We already stayed there last night!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“<i>Oh.</i>” Stephanie scowled.  “She didn’t <i>tell me that</i> when she scheduled your appointment.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“Is… that a problem?” August broached cautiously, Stephanie relaxing slightly, and then exhaling dramatically.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“No.  No, it’s fine, she does this sometimes.  Which of you wants to go first?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P92">“I-I’ll do it.” August stuttered, looking back at June and squeezing her hand, June smiling back.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P93">The woman paused for a moment, before shaking her head slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P94">“Okay, you first.  C’mon.” the woman waved, before pausing for a moment, as if being told something by an untold voice. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P95">Right, telepathy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P96">She shook her head, half-dejectedly before looking back at the pair of them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P97">“Nevermind. It seems your interviews will be conducted concurrently.  Both of you, follow me.” she said through an incurious affect.  With intentional and nervous movement, August and June disappeared around the corner into a maze of hallways.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">The two carefully made their way across the carpeted office, a clear relic of luxury that the complex no longer had, windows boarded with any haphazard flat materials from shattered glass, shards still embedded in the carpet in places.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P98">“What happened here…?” June muttered under her breath as Stephanie huffed.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P99"><span>“What do you </span><i>think happened</i><span>,</span><i> </i><i>Volokhov</i><i>?”</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P98">She didn’t respond, growing weary of adults and their casual cruelty.  As the woman kept walking, August realized she <i>also </i>had a ring on her left hand, same as Karina, same as so many others.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P100">She was a magical girl too.  She just was a whole lot meaner than most.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P101">Stephanie stopped in front of a room labeled “Interview”, the placard well worn, the metallic accents flaking off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P101">“In you go.” she waved, August and June taking a seat in the room at the table.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P101">The lights turned on once they sat down, their <i>interviewer</i> already waiting.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P101">“August and June Kisaki, eh?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">The girls both nodded, the magical girl continuing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“Birthplace?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P102">“Uh…Freiburg Specialized in <span>Nova Sicilia…. Galileo-Mu.”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“You don’t need to be that specific.  Also, just say if you don’t know.” the girl chided, both of them nodding nervously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“You were adopted?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“By the Kisakis, yeah.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“<i>Those</i> Kisakis?  The <i>matriarchy</i> of Itsumi Kisaki<i>?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“Kinda. Estranged branch.  They weren’t allowed to adopt kids from the other family members apparently.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P103">The magical girl nodded, her short cut jet black hair waving slightly at the action.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“Have you been in combat before?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“If you count trying to get the hell out of it, sure.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“Have you fired a gun before?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P102">“What happened after the Kisakis adopted you and your sister?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">August paused, overcome with memories of the bubble collapse, and then… and then… gunfire.  Screaming.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P105">The magical girl didn’t need mind-reading to see how much she was struggling, awkwardly mumbling “Let’s change the topic, okay?” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P106">June was all the more grateful, nodding on her sister’s behalf.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Why does <i>anyone</i> move these days; for a better life.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Hah, fair enough.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Any skills?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“We can cook.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“No, August can cook.  I just act as assistant.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“That it?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Well she can fire a gun and I learn fast.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Favorite colors?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Pink!” chimed June, August, admitting sheepishly that she prefers red.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Oooh, a divergence, interesting!” the girl laughed, both relaxing slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Now, have either of you been eligible for contract?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“We’re the right age but I haven’t seen an Incubator or been contacted.” August said truthfully, June averting her eyes, if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“You do know how it <i>works</i>, just to be sure, right?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“I think so.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">The magical girl relaxed in her chair slightly, a devilish smile on her face.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P104">“All-right then,<i> </i><i>Kisaki</i><i>-chan.  </i>Enlighten me.”</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P104">“Uh so.  A <span>girl</span> about our age, has <i>potential</i>, whatever that is.  <span>If you tell an Incubator your wish, they can make </span><span>a </span><span>gem, one that can take the form of a ring, that taps into the your own inherent power, </span><span>the power of your soul.</span><span>”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P107">She hesitated for a moment, the strands of searches she’d seen before it all went down, Galileo’s musing on <i>soul gems </i>lingering on the edge of her thoughts.  About grief, corruption, wraiths, Incubators and their pursuit to reduce entropy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“Good answer.” the magical girl said coolly, August blissfully ignorant that their interviewer <i>got every piece of it</i><i>.  </i> She fired off a message to Karina mentally, inquiring whether or not she noticed that the girls knew more about soul gems than they let on.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">In what felt like an instant, Karina shot back three characters.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P109">NO‽</p>
<p class="paragraph-P110">The Incubator says the younger one has a lot of potential too, despite the potential for it to go all Aurora on us.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P111">That bad?  Is it even worth the risk then?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P110">Do we have a choice?  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">As the interview continued, the questions grew more and more strange, August getting more and more concerned what they walked into.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">“Which weighs more, a kilo of feathers or a kilo of metal?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">“Uh- they’re the sam-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">“Correct.  What smell do you most closely associate with your mother?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">“Cinnamon, but-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">“Would you rather traverse a dark path with a flashlight, or a slippery, well illuminated path?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P108">“I don’t know, uh, the flashlight one?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P112">After the barrage of questions, their interviewer paused, a voice appearing directly in the minds of the Kisakis without the interviewer moving her mouth.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P113">Do you have a wish prepared?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P113">Yes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P114">With a nod, a small furry creature stepped out of the shadows of the interview room, leaping onto the table with ease, and taking a seat next to the magical girl.  Golden rings suspended around long ears, white fur flowing into pink, and unblinking round eyes staring at them as much as it was<i> through</i> them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P114">“An Incubator!” August balked, June’s expression more despondent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P114">“So it <i>was</i> one of you in that dream…” she confessed, her resolve palpable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P114">“You had a dream involving an Incubator <i>before</i> you contracted?  Huh..."</p>
<p class="paragraph-P113">June Kisaki, what wish will make your soul gem shine?</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P114">Augus<span>t’s voice raised to a shrill tone </span><span>as she leapt out of her seat</span>, “Don’t! Please!”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P114">June smiled at her sister, overtaken by an implacable sense of serenity.  With a careful gesture, she gave her a hug, trying to make the moment last.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P114">“It’s okay sis.  You’ve protected me since we lost Mom and Dad.  Now, it’s my turn to protect you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P115">The Incubator’s head tilted askew, a mimic of human and animal traits, uncharacteristic and even more horrifying, it chose to respond to her pleas.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P116">Why would you not want this for her, Kisaki-kun?  Her soul shines for this, as does yours.  Your sister has immense ability to reduce net entropy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P117">“Juni, please, don’t do this!  Incubator, please, I’ll do anything, <i>please</i>!  <i>Anything </i>but this!” August balked, tears cascading down her face onto the table as held her sister tight.  June gently withdrew from August’s embrace, standing up and looking at the Incubator expectantly, the telepath interviewer moving to act in an instant.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P117">With a quick nod, August collapsed onto the floor, unconscious and dreaming of a world without wishes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P118">As the room flooded with a brilliant pink light, Stephanie watched through the observation window with glee.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P104">“A new Kisaki contract, huh…”</p>

<div class="paragraph-P124">August lurched upright in the medical bay bed, an older bearded man already urging her to relax.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P124">“August, it’s okay, you’re safe, just <i>relax.</i>” he cooed, August straining slightly as she collapsed back into bed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“What… what happened?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“You and your sister-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Wait! Where’s June!  Please, tell me that nightm-”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P125">The doctor’s otherwise cordial disposition was replaced by one implacable.  Somewhere between guilt and pity <span>she thought, still dizzy.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Your sister is safe too.  She’s going through training with Karina.” he huffed, August’s face awash with anguish.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P125">“I’m Doctor <span>Craig</span> Riddel, but please, call me Craig.” <span>the bearded man said, trimmed close and kept proper.  An immaculate labcoat, </span><span>clean shoes, the works.  He practically </span><i>reeked</i><span> of a 21</span><span>st</span><span> century doctor.  An anachronism in practice, in what </span><i>felt</i><span> like a concrete tomb.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Doct-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Doctors orders, don’t call me by that damned title.  Please. I didn’t earn it.” he grumbled, each syllable hung on his tongue more than the last.  In an instant, he was focusing on seemingly anything but her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Craig.” she weakly muttered, his face lit up with joy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Excellent!  Now, August, how are you<i> feeling</i>?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P126">“Like I’ve been run through a meat grinder.” she <span>mumbled</span>, trying to brush away a strand of hair out of her face, <span>staring at the glass windows that revealed only rock.  The blasted sandstone of the subway far above replaced </span><span>with hastily produced concrete, small bits of gravel still visible if she squinted at the gentle gradient of reds and oranges.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Well, that’s one way to describe<i> </i><i>that</i> combat<i> </i>zone…” he said, voice trailing off as he gave the girl a look of pity.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">After a moment, August couldn’t help but ask the obvious, “Doc-sorry.  <i>Craig.  Do you know w</i>hen can I <i>leave</i>?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“Not for a bit.  You are <i>long since overdue</i> for a checkup.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P125">“You <i>know that stuff​​?”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P127">Craig belly-laughed at her, her embarrassment apparent.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P128">“I’m making an educated guess, honestly.  Very few people have as of late, but you have some more lingering issues.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“What do you ­<i>mean</i>?” August balked, trying to steel herself for needles and agony.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“It looks like the experience of watching your sister contract in conjunction with a, let’s say <i>inelegant </i>telepath knocking you unconscious left you with parts of your brain in a less than ideal state.  I’d normally suggest therapy, but-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“No therapists, huh…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“Oh we have them, they’re just <i>not here.</i>  They’re on the front near <i>Nova Sicilia</i>.  The most direct support group for magical girls there, since the risk is so great.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P129">Risk of <span>despair.  Psychological damage.  Grief.  </span><span>I’d read about them, about… what some think happens in their afterlife.  A moment frozen in eternity.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P130">Sounds awful.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">An awkward silence hung in the air,  the tension only cut by a cleaning robot attending to the hallway outside.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“So… what do I do then?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“My advice?  Talk to your sister.” he advised, pulling out a small applicator from a drawer opposite to her, and applying ointment to her scabs from countless falls on the way to the city.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P131">“<i>How?</i>  She contracted, she’s a <i>magical girl!” </i>she winced, the venom in the words throwing Craig off from perfectly applying the salve.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P129">I guess she’s got some less than ideal feeling about ‘em.  I can’t blame her too much, but… they’re all we’ve got right now.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P129">“She’s still your sister, August.  And besides… it’s not like you can’t join her.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P132">“I am <i>not</i> contracting!” she spat, Craig’s displeasure palpable.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P132">“You don’t have to <i>right now. </i> We still need more folks who can support <i>them</i> in combat.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P132">“So what, they’re safe and I’m not, and I just get shot by someone else with big-ass bullets?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P132">“Safest place in all of this is either in a bunker like I am, or by the side of magical girls, believe it or not.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P132">“I <i>don’t</i>.  I got my sister here safe, that means <i>something!”</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P133">“Sure does.  It means you can keep others safe.  But you’ve been largely a <i>non-target</i>.  It’s been magical girls fighting each <i>other</i>.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P134">The words echoed in August’s mind, each heartbeat driving her more distant from Craig’s assurances.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“And just like that, you’re done.  A little gene therapy, a few nanite upgrades, and the upgraded Emergency Mode.” he prattled off with ease.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“Upgraded <i>how?</i>” August mumbled, still reeling from the dizzying conversation they’d had moments prior.        </p>
<p class="paragraph-P128">“Ehh… hard to say.  It’s an improvement and the number of civilians reporting medical issues <i>did</i> drop.  I’d assume it’s correlated.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">August feigned a laugh, Craig’s demeanor softening again, ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Don’t they tell you these things, you’re a doctor after all.” she asked, half-hoping he’d take it in good faith.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P136">Through a weary smile, Craig couldn’t help but respond earnestly.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P137">“A doctor, not a mathematician.  Besides, not like Halley has been around to crunch numbers for me.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P138">Halley.  Oh god, Galileo.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Okay, Doc-Craig.  Sorry, I-” she rushed, words spilling over one another as she bolted out of the bed, struggling to let the bed’s arms lower.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“I-really-need-to-go-and-see” she spewed through shallow breaths, “if-my-friend-Galileo-is-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Oh <i>no you don’t!” </i>Craig raised, the door shutting as he mentally tripped a lockdown for the room.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“You are <i>not</i> allowed back in the combat zone unless you’re with a magical girl.  That’s MSY’s policy and it’s going to be the one you’re <i>running by.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Stop-being-so-stupid-why-!?” she yelped, still flailing wildly as the door opened again.  In a moment of panic, she steadied herself, and found herself face to face with Karina Luhr, in full magical girl regalia, spare one difference.  A gun strapped to her thigh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Because your Emergency TNC Petition was approved.  Welcome to the team, August.” she smiled, her new teammate groaning with anguish.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P139">“And you passed with flying colors!  Most try to stab me with the coatrack in the foyer!” she smiled, August in utter disbelief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P139">“So, because you evidently do fairly well in fighting, despite being otherwise untrained, my boss thought it wise to train you up the way other TNCs have been historically.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P139">“And that means…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P139">“Guns, self defense, medical, and a non-zero amount of telepathic resistance training.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P139">“Telepathic self-defense…” she mumbled to herself, before her cheeks turned crimson, yelping “What the hell did your telepath see?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“About what we’d expect for someone who tried to stop her sister from contracting…” Karina admitted sheepishly, indifferent to August’s <i>embarrassment</i> in place of fear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“What- you…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P140">Dr. Riddel couldn’t help but interrupt her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P140">“Pardon me for interrupting, First Lieutenant Luhr-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P140">“Craig, I already told you about this, if I can’t call you doctor, <i>you </i>can’t call me First Lieutenant!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P141">“Fine, <i>Karina.  </i>Why <i>lie</i> to her?  TNC Petitions?  Preposterous! Those aren’t a thing!”  he growled, his anger broiling over into disappointment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P142">Karina couldn’t help but shrink a little, and August couldn’t help but grow fonder at the sight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P143">Even Luhr-sama gets nervous, and she’s been doing this for decades.  Maybe it’s not such a bad thing to be afraid.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Okay so, admittedly, I <i>might’ve</i> lied about the TNC Petition thing.” she shuddered, eyes averted and staring at the polished-to-a-mirror floors.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“What do you mean <i>lied!”</i> August balked, barely containing her dismay.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P144">“Well, TNCs haven’t been a thing since the <span>Unification</span> <span>W</span>ar<span>s</span>.  I needed <i>something</i> that sounded right to describe, well… you being allowed to do stuff without being contracted.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P142">August raised her hand for a moment, as if to respond, and found herself struggling to process too many ideas, too many <i>theories</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P142">“Why…?” she mumbled, her face plastered with confusion.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P142">The magical girl conceded, and nodded to Dr. Riddel to release the lockdown, as the door unlatched, Karina only in the moment noticing she’d ripped the lock out of the wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P135">“Hey August, let’s go for a walk.  C’mon.” she gestured, as the two of them exited the patient room, nervously chuckling at Dr. Riddel.  The pair turned towards the arrow on the wall with neat script in Standard saying “Gallery”.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“<span>So… wait.</span><span>  Why the hell couldn’t you just</span><i> tell me</i><span>?” August squawked. </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“Because Craig <i>doesn’t</i> need to hear this part.  You’re involved with MSY now because of your sister’s wish.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“Wait, her <i>wish​</i>?  What the hell even <i>is it?”</i> August beckoned, only to be met with Karina shaking her head softly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“Sorry, you should know as well as any family member of a magical girl, it’s on her to share it with you.  Not my place to share it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“But she’s my sister!” August whined, Karina’s face filling with dismay.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P146">“And she’s my second lieutenant.  Apparently.” Karina said, incredulous. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P147">August wanted to be upset with her, absolutely furious.  She couldn’t quite shake the feeling that Karina wasn’t exactly <i>enthusiastic</i> about June contracting though...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“Did you ask for her specifically?  Or was it just <i>dumb luck</i> you got my sister?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“Does it matter?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P145">“It matters <i>to me.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">After a silence that felt like an eternity, Karina capitulated, feeling absolutely remiss how <i>easily</i> she swayed her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P149">“She requested it, actually.  I think she figured that between your civilian status and being housed in my family’s home, she’d have the best chance at still being in your life and protecting you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P149">“Protect <i>me</i>?  She’s the one about to leap into danger!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">Karina paused for a moment, looking up at the archway protecting the interior dome, “Gallery” written in Standard, glyphs below it shimmering ever so slightly.  Karina wasn’t sure she was supposed to be able to read it, none the wiser that August couldn’t even see them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P150">As she glanced into the gallery, her eyes found the magical girl working on a floral figure halfway down the room.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P151">Can you give us some space Andrea?  Doing a little theological chat with a family member.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P152">The girl’s head turned towards her, her response carrying an undeniable tone of frustration.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P151">But I was in the middle of this!  I really had something going! </p>
<p class="paragraph-P152">Karina couldn’t help but roll her eyes as the magical girl continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P151">If this “Tiro Finale” looks wrong on the setting of Tomoe-san, you can fix it yourself!  Ugh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P151">Sure…. Whatever Andrea. Karina thought absentmindedly, as she realized August was looking at her. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P148">“What do you know about the cult, August?” Karina asked, her voice <span>distant</span> as she <span>looked</span> up at the worn sandstone and carved rock.  The faces of magical girls past.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“The <i>cult​?  </i>The Church, you mean.” she said, Karina’s attention drawn back to her response.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P153">Huh. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“True enough.  Different names for the same thing.  The difference historically is <i>belief.</i>” she quipped, August growing more confused by the minute.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“It’s… the faith of magical girls, right?” she repeated, her voice meeker as she watched Karina’s face contorting slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P154">“Close.  Most refer to Her like that.” August yielded, the girl leaving the room as she finally relaxed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P154">“More than anything, it’s a hope that after this life, that our good deeds and harm don’t cancel each other out, no matter how we leave this life.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P155">“First of all, <i>Her</i>?  Capital “H” and all?” August asked, trying to be careful with her words.  She knew some of this, of course, you always learn reading rumors.  Rumors were one thing though, and an accidental pop-quiz of religion<i> with</i> a magical girl was something else entirely.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P156">Karina didn’t seem to mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“If she’s a Goddess, it’s proper and all, right?” Karina said fondly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“I wouldn’t know.” August nodded, half-heartedly encouraging her to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“Besides, Law of Cycles is a <i>mouthful</i> at times.” Karina giggled, August unable to resist smiling a little.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P157">It sounds nice in a way.  <span>A proper goddess, </span><span>h</span><span>ope against </span><span>d</span><span>espair?</span><span>  Wishes are miracles of our own witness, if even some of the stories I’ve read are to be believed.  </span><span>Maybe it’s not as bad as I’d thought, but it’s not like I can ask someone their experiences with the afterlife.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P148">“What’s with the bit about stuff canceling out though?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P158">Karina’s head was hung in shame for a moment, her gaze averted from August, before glancing back at her with pitying eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P159">“It’s so that our wishes weren’t made for no reason.  That at the worst of our despair, a Goddess of Hope would save us, that all of it was for <i>something.</i>” she said, her eyes focused on the facsimile of a girl August didn’t recognize, but one that Karina <i>clearly</i> did. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P160"><span> </span><span>A girl’s silhouette</span><span> </span><span>carved from stone, </span><span>a fascia recognizable to a select few, but on display </span><span>so far from her </span><span>original </span><span>home, </span><span>the facsimile of a soul gem on her stomach </span><span>accompanied by musical notes and swords.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P161">A knight by another other name...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P162">They kept walking, Karina’s heels clattering on the floor as August’s sneakers tread lightly. It was hard for her <i>not</i> to observe some reverence, but she faltered upon seeing the end of the chamber.  It was <i>incomplete.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P163">“Karina… at the end.  Is that…?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P163">“That’s her.  Of sorts.  As far as we can tell based on what Akemi-san has said.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body"><span>“Which one is </span><span>Akemi-san</span><span>?” August asked cautiously, </span><span>eyes darting from</span><i> </i><span>statue</span><span> to</span><i> </i><span>statue</span><span>, </span><span>motifs of </span><span>chains </span><span>and </span><span>spears </span><span>yielding </span><span>to </span><span>muskets and florals.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P164">August found herself instinctually looking at the representation of their goddess of hope, confused by the scaffolding next to the ghostly figure.  The Goddess herself wore a serene look, holding a facsimile of the Earth in her hands.  The scaffolding adjacent laid dormant, scarcely used it seemed.  Net meshes had the smallest pieces of debris and dust, something started and not quite finished.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P164">As her eyes were drawn towards the Earth again, as she squinted her eyes slightly, hoping she’d see better through the textile, she made out the slightest hint of a hand reaching up towards the Goddess’ hands, the profile of a star visible on a fingernail.  The chalked outline of another by her side, present and absent, all at once.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P165">“<span>The original plans allegedly had her next to her Goddess</span>, but… not this time.” <span>Karina</span><span> glowered, </span><span>her gaze drilling into the dark-as-the-night flooring, a motif taken with grace from an atrium of similar purpose on Earth.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P165">“Why <i>not</i>?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P166">Karina paused for a moment, realizing that August almost sounded <i>hurt</i> on her behalf.  As if, despite every reason not to, she still cared about what she had to say.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P166">“<span>Itsumi </span>Kisaki.” <span>Karina </span><span>winced, </span><span>half-regretting it as soon as the words left her mouth.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P166">“Kisaki?  Like the matriarch‽  I’m adopted anyways, not like we’re related!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P167">“You bear their name, so… I’m sure others will assume you bear the burden of responsibility too.” she admitted, August still reeling.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P168">Besides, your sister will inevitably be targeted as a new contractee, bearing your family name...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P167">“The <i>matriarch </i>was very insistent on the “heretical nature” of Akemi Homura’s claims.  Saying that she has <i>no right </i>to claim to be the messenger of the Law of Cycles.” she stated plainly, emphasis on the allegations cast, as if sharing catty gossip.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P169">“Heretical? How can she be <i>heretical</i> when she’s the one who explained it to her fellow magical girls in Mitakihara‽  She’s the one who they made the damned <i>movie</i> about!  She was the <i>First </i><i>damned</i><i> Executive!</i>” August exclaimed, arms waving as she stumbled for a moment, Karina catching her, and brushing off the moment as quickly as she could.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P170">The silence hung in the air as Karina tried to collect herself, August gulping nervously as she realized with horror why she felt so <i>strange</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P171">She had a crush.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P170">“Hey August.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P170">“Yeah?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P170">“Why do you <i>know </i><i>all that</i><i>?” </i>Karina asked, her gaze in shadow still. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P172">“I… think I read it somewhere online.  Not sure.  <span>Maybe the movie about her?</span>” <span>she mumbled, hoping desperately to change the topic </span><span>as she barreled onward.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P172">“I thought the movie wasn’t even out yet?” Karina asked cautiously, a raised eyebrow and a funny face cutting the tension better than she might’ve expected otherwise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P172">“It might not be… I learned about her in history lessons though.  And then read the previews.. I mean, who <i>wouldn’t</i>?  She’s <i>awesome!</i>” she gushed, not quite processing that the <i>movie star</i> she was so infatuated with were closer to Karina’s <i>boss </i>than any other term that might fit better<i>.  </i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P172">“Still though!  It’s absolutely no fair they try to say it’s <i>heresy.</i>  Why didn’t the Church get upset over it?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P172">“<span>They did, </span><span>despite the blowback.</span>  There’s a reason that MSY <span>and the </span><span>Kisaki </span><span>matriarchy </span><span>fought </span><span>over it</span>.  Even if you want to argue about this Goddess being <i>“</i><i>religious claptrap</i><i>”</i> as one rumor put it, the existence of Akemi Homura isn’t exactly <i>debatable.</i>  <span>The only debate was </span><span>after</span> New Athens, <span>about</span>…”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P173">Karina found herself staring up at the ceiling of the gallery, a night sky painted with such diligence and observation that the human eye might mistake it for the real thing.  That is, if it weren’t the night sky of a world millions of kilometers away.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P174">A night sky bursting with weapons-fire over the horizon, blotted out by wings cut from nightmares, victory seized from the jaws of demise…  </p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P175"><span>Akemi</span><span> Homura did not expect to wake up in a hospital bed.  She didn’t expect to </span><i>wake up.</i><span>  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P176">She had been… <i>some</i><i>place</i><i> else</i>, her head swirling with memories disconnected and amorphous, colors wiped and distorted.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P177">Timeline… This has been Hers for a very long time.  Why am I thinking of timelines?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P178">She rolled out of the hospital bed as if by rote memorization, reaching for glasses on an absent table as though she had a need for the anachronism.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P177">Ah.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P179">As she came to, she inspected her person, making sure nothing was amiss.  It was <i>unusual</i> for her to sleep, given that she hadn’t <i>needed to</i> in nearly three hundred years, but the last thing she checked, of course, was a mirror.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P180">And she found absent the <i>most important thing</i> she’d ever been steward to.  The Ribbon. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P180">The <span>gift</span> wore at all times, the sister strand to the one in Mitakihara in the chamber of the same origination.  The one she’d so cautiously been guarding since <span>h</span>er <i>wish</i>.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P181">Madoka, I’m so sorry.  I’ll get back to you. I promise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P182">As she instinctually attempted to summon her wings, she found herself lacking them, as she glanced down to find a shield on her wrist, gasping in disbelief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P183">How...</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P184"><span>August</span> still wanted so desperately to know her sister’s wish, and she might be on the team, but she wasn’t <i>one of the girls.</i><span>  She didn’t want to be, not after the </span><i>nightmare</i><span> they’d had to endure to get to this city.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P185">But it might be her best chance of protecting her sister, despite her protests.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“So… do you still expect me to contract?” August asked Karina awkwardly, as they arrived back at the hospital room, Dr. Riddel still waiting for her, waving cheerfully through the glass as Karina held the bridge of her nose.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Sorry, just let me-” she started, reaching inside the room and setting the windows to “privacy” as Craig vanished behind an opaque off-white film suspended between the panes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“He’s all too happy to chat, <i>all the time</i>.  It eats me alive…” Karina grumbled.  “Sorry, you were saying?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“I said… do you still want me to contract?  I <i>don’t</i> want to, and I don’t think the wish I had ready really <i>works</i> anymore if she contracted…” August admitted gloomily.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P186">“But if <i>you</i> think I should, I’ll do it.” she said, a confidence in her voice Karina admired, but couldn’t stomach encouraging.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P186">“August Kisaki, don’t you dare contract for anyone but <i>yourself.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P186">“But I want to help oth-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P186">“August!  We <i>all help others.</i>  We’re all dependent on one another, that’s what <i>humanity is.”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">August was taken aback, the outburst crushing her ever visibly, body racked with anguish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P188">“Come up with a good wish.  One that you <i>really believe in.</i>  One that isn’t about some <i>silly crush</i>, or your sister.  One that’s big enough to fit your whole heart into.”  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P189">Karina felt absurd being so <i>pointed about it</i>, but it was clear that August’s crush wasn’t going to go away unless she did <i>something</i> about it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P190">The last thing I need is the only potential contractee the Incubators have supervised to succumb to despair and vanish as soon as they contract.  Shannon would never forgive me if she did, wherever she is...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“Not my soul?” she inquired, her head askew slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“Your soul is in the gem.  Your heart, is what goes in the wish.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“Never heard that before.” August mumbled, Karina sheepishly scratching her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“Neither have I, I just made it up.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“I hope you’re better at mission execution than you are at poetry Karina, or else you’re going to get shot…” Craig muttered from the door-frame.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“A mission?  I’ll be right up then.” she smiled, “August, talk to Craig about getting some <i>actual food</i>.  When was the last time you ate, at my house?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“Shit.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“I <i>thought so.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“At least the bread was good…” she grumbled, Karina’s face awash in joy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P187">“It really was.  Next time, I’m asking for a cake!”</p>

<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“<span>Okay, I’ve got bread still, stuff made by a lovely Barrier Generator named </span><span>Seika</span><span>, and…” Craig began, picking up a glass jar of jam from the fridge and squinting at the label.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Looks like one that Karina-san had at her home…” August mumbled absentmindedly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“It’s… apparently orange and elderflower preserves.  The label says “Lullaby” though, in… Swedish, I think?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“Why <i>do</i> the Luhrs have such an interest in language?  The sign on their door was in more than one language too.” August awkwardly stumbled out, Craig pulling over the stool at the table opposite to her in the kitchenette.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P191">“Well… I think it was mostly Shannon’s doing, frankly.  She was worldly; a venerable historian <span>in training</span>.  For a while she had aspirations of studying under Clarisse van Rossum, like Julian Bradshaw got the chance to <span>when he started out.</span>”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“Did she get to?” August asked, her ears perked at the mentions of people so <i>well known</i>, even this far out.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“Hm... I don’t <i>think</i> so.  The Contact War put a bit of a damper on most people’s plans though…” Dr. Riddel grumbled, dismissing the discontent as easily as it’d arrived.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“So she knows Swedish when <i>in a jam</i>, Japanese by marriage, English by convention.  What’s next, <i>French?”</i> August balked, Craig bursting into laughter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P191">“Goddess I hope not!” he hollered, August’s cackling tamped only by her sudden realization.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P192">He said Goddess too.  What the frick?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P192">“Hey Doc-I… Craig?” she asked cautiously, Dr. Riddel’s hand turning; a gesture to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Why do<i> you</i> believe in that Goddess the magical girls do?  Not like we’d get to see their heaven or anything.” August mumbled, relishing the texture of the berries.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Do you mind if I-” Riddel asked, August nodding as he quickly scarfed down some more bread, jam, and cheese.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P193">Coughing to clear his throat as he poured himself a glass of something called “rangpur lumiade” the color of strawberry milk, and <span>fairly tart, </span><span>coughing through the acidity as August couldn’t help but snort.  </span><span>As his esophagus stopped betraying him so dearly, he explained.</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P193">“August my dear, I’m a middle-aged man, nearly one-hundred and twenty.  I will <i>eventually</i> see my own mortality, whether by fighting <span>in </span>here, or cephalapod out <i>there</i>.<i>  </i><i>I may have survived mandatory service, barely, but that doesn’t mean death doesn’t happen.  </i><span>Given </span><span>that</span><i>,</i><span> I</span> want to believe in <i>something</i>, and frankly, magical girls seem to be privy to the miracles of our time.  I see no reason to not believe in<i> one more.”</i></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P193">August took a moment to chew on her words <span>as well as </span><span>the</span><span> bread, </span><span>the</span><span> aroma </span><span>of the </span><span>orange </span><span>cutting through the elderflower</span><span>, a</span><span> proverbial summer spread in something </span><span>that’d be right at home on a 21</span><span>st</span><span> century </span><span>Earth.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P194">I see no reason to not believe in one more miracle.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“I guess that’s fair… thank you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“No, thank you for asking!  Most just assume I’m some tragic old man lamenting a lost girlfriend.” he laughed, August raising an eyebrow cautiously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Oh no, no, don’t you start!” he laughed, August giggling at his antics.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P193">“Now.  We’ve gotten a snack, what do you say about <i>some actual food</i>.” he exclaimed, his enthusiasm contagious as August burst into cheer.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P195">As he strode across the kitchenette, Craig tapped open a door hand-labeled “SECRET” as out popped his <i>real food</i>.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">August was <i>incredibly</i> disappointed that “real food” constituted ration bars.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">“So you eat this…stuff... <i>all the time?”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">“Excuse me, miss August.  Weren’t <i>you </i>more-or-less scavenging for a few months?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P196">“Most homes here had better food than something that feels like tree bark…” she grumbled, half-way through a bite that erupted with a cacophonous shattering sound.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P197">Riddel grimaced through his last bite cautiously, as if not to let her get in a word in edgewise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P198">“I’d rather spend my time treating patients than cooking… I’ve got to get back to one soon anyways.” he mumbled, checking his chronometer.  August took a few extra ration bars, shoving them into her bag quickly, taking the chance to refill her water bottle.  Craig absentmindedly chewed his ration bar before dry-swallowing, coughing twice, and then hoarsely finished the thought.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P196">“She’s <span>a bit of a special case, seeing as how she was… well.  Nevermind.  She’s </span>likely to wake up soon.” </div>
<p class="paragraph-P199"> </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P200">“<span>So,</span><span> Craig kicked you out </span><span>of the little kitchen</span><span>, huh?” </span><span>Karina laughed weakly, the door behind her ajar slightly.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P200">“We got toast and some really odd lemonade!” August mumbled, her voice mired with exhaustion.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P200">“Oh the lumiade?  He loves to give that stuff to new folks to see how much they hate it.” Karina smiled, August indifferent to the attempted hazing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P200">“He had most of it, to be honest.” she shrugged, Karina </p>
<p class="paragraph-P200">“Wait, really?  That <i>jerk!  </i>Thank you, I’m gonna beat him up over this later.” she winked at August, smiling fondly, still clearly enjoying the idea of being <i>friendly</i> with her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“So… uh…” Karina chattered, “we’re gonna probably take June on a training mission today.  So, as much as I’d love for you to come along… I don’t think you can go.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“What!?  But Craig said I can go out with a magical girl! And you said I was <i>on the team!</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P201">“I… not like that though.  Besides, it’s <i>training!</i>  Your training and hers are going to be different by necessity.  Last thing I’d want is to run into a demon spawn and you to get hurt.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“And what does <i>June</i> say about that?” August balked, trying to keep her cool.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“I didn’t ask her.  It’s not <i>up to her. Or me</i>, for that matter.<i>”</i>Karina admitted, August’s posture collapsing with defeat, as her body hung heavy in the corridor.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">With her head still hung by the weight of reality, she mumbled in response, defeated.  “Okay…. Is there anything I can do at your house then?  I <i>really </i>don’t wanna go to the gallery again.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“Wait, why not?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“Going by myself feels… odd?  I don’t know.  It’s not my faith, y’know?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P203">Karina raised her hand as if to argue, glancing at her own hand and caught her soul gem, in ring form, glimmering slightly as she thought better of it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P204">I’ve got a heart, but I’ve got to have a soul too.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“Well, if you want to, there’s a library in the house you can thumb through.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“Wait, like… paper and book?  Like the cookbook?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“I know real paper books are something of an oddity, but Shannon really did like to keep paper copies.  A lot of it was migrated from Earth or other Core Worlds by her family.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P205">“Think she’s got anything on magical girls contracting?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P206">“So you don’t lose your mind over your sister?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P207">She nodded, her demeanor already improving by the minute.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P208">“I think it was Parenting Plexus Online…” she mumbled, pausing.  “Well, I guess this is offline?  But, besides the point I guess.  There should be some stuff on getting through it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P209">August couldn’t help but soften at the thought.  Despite how angry she was, Karina genuinely seemed to want to help.  Even if there were rules, even if she was just the messenger.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P208">“Sisterhood By Sisterhood is the chapter you want.” Karina continued, August gingerly raising her hand.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“Hey… Karina?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“Yeah?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P202">“Why did you know that offhandedly?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P210">Karina grimaced slightly, before putting on a pleasant smile.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P210">“Let’s just say you’re not the first girl to have her sister contract.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P210">August got up and dusted her jumper off before pausing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P210">“Wait, can I get a key to the tunnels?  I want to be able to get through with June on the off-chance you’re busy.” she asked, half-expecting an outright rejection.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P211">“After training, yes.  Ophelia would rip my head off if she found out I gave you a key without any of the rules or expectations.” Karina said plainly, finishing on a smile that betrayed the risk.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P212">I can’t just let her go down there un<span>esc</span>orted.  Some things do go bump in the night, and we don’t know what they are yet.</div>

<div class="paragraph-P210">“<span>Ugh, </span><i>fine.</i><span>” she grumbled, hoping </span><span>Karina</span><span> renege on her choice, </span><span>to no avail</span><span>.  Then again, </span><i>June </i><span>might have more success.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P210">“I gotta go to a meeting, can you head down towards the practice room?  Your sister should be there sparring with Jenna Weaver.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P210">“Oh!  Okay!” August beamed, practically sprinting before she skidded on the floor, and ran back.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P210">“Wait, where <i>is </i>the practice room?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P210">“Follow the signs?” Karina replied, pointing at the signs in Standard gingerly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P210">“Thank you…” August nervously laughed, before walking quickly the way she’d run the first time.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P213">That girl really does love her sister a lot. </p>

<p class="paragraph-P215">“It’s not that I don’t want to work with her, because I <i>don’t</i>, it’s that she’s a fucking Kisaki!”</p>

<p class="paragraph-P216">Grabbing Dr. Riddel’s collar, the man dropped from frozen time with a lurch as he yelped, Homura staring at him with her characteristic neutral demeanor, speaking in the hollow tone her friends heard after New Athens.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P216">“Where did you put it?  One chance.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P217">“WHAT-” Craig screamed, struggling against her grip as she dropped him, Riddel freezing mid-descent as she went back to the hospital room, then returning and dragging him with her, feet on the floor as she strode effortlessly into the room.</p>

<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“<span>Cassandra</span><span> Harakka.” the Incubator spoke into her mind, its face </span><span>unmoving, lips </span><span>curled</span><span> in perpetual smile.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P219">She hated it more than anything alive, spare the Cephalapods.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Incubator.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Cassandra, <i>r</i><i>umors</i> that you’re responsible for the reduction in demon spawns have reached my kind.  As a valuable contractee, we hope you’ll be able to tell us the true nature of these rumors.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Maybe, Incubator.  Maybe I <i>have </i>interfered.” she quipped, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p class="paragraph-Text_20_body">“Based on prior interaction, it seemed evident to us that magical girls understood the underlying goal, the requisite outcome of demon harvesting.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P220"><span>Cassandra rolled her eyes, the worn wooden chair carrying her frame, her frilly costume still at odds </span><span>with her demeanor</span><span>, the gray and black motifs barely visible in the room’</span><span>s gloomy atmosphere, spare a lamp on the coffee table next to her.  T</span><span>he round bed in the center </span><span>of the room over her shoulder</span><span> draped with curtains, </span><span>glittery stars embroidered into the textile</span><span>.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P221">“Then why don’t you <i>enlighten me</i> if I’ve missed the mark so clearly?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P222">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P223">The Incubator jumped onto the coffee table with ease, barely registering as its paws softly thudded into the well loved surface, end grain imported from yet another distant world.  Expensive, ornate, and not as <i>efficient</i> as the Incubators would approve of.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P222">“Cassandra, this universe <i>will</i> collapse from heat death if demons aren’t harvested for grief cubes.  Grief cubes are fundamental to the cycle of energy that sustains your species.  Since you made your wish, they’ve become instrumental to the survival of this small universe.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P224">“I know.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P225">“If you don’t allow demon spawns, everyone in this universe, human, magical girl, incubator, will die.  This universe would enter an irreparable high-entropy state, ending reality as you know it.  Surely you understand this.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P225">“I do.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P224">“Why contract only to invalidate your own wish then?  Why hold the universe you formed <i>hostage</i>?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P226">She felt herself grow angrier, the Incubator perpetually able to get under her skin, despite her best efforts.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P227">“Because you Incubators needed incentive to <i>behave.” </i>she grimaced, her jaw clenched with frustration.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P228"><i>“</i>You contract who I tell you, and when.  <i>No one else.</i>  My wish, my rules, my universe.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P229">“You’re behaving irrationally.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P230">“Yeah well, humans are like that.  Didn’t another Incubator say it’s inherent to emotions?” she mumbled, collapsing into the wooden chair again, the armrests worn from her gripping of the ends.  Weeks prior, she didn’t have to worry about her grip shattering the heirloom, but her newfound strength had presented unexpected frustrations.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P231">“Cassandra, my species considers individual emotions to be a mental illness.  Incompatible with our very existence.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P231">“So you’ve said.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P232">“And yet, a part of my conscious self can’t ignore the presence of fear.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P232">“Fear?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P232">“As the resident expert, would you describe fear as an emotion?  Or is it best viewed as a physiological primitive in the context of experience?” the Incubator frowned.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P232">“After all, we lack a prior context window to describe the outcome of your wish as anything but <i>unprecedented.”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P233">She kept her face level, attempting to avoid its observation of her reaction.  Sheer and absolute fear.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P234">Fear?  Incubators can feel fear?  Even if I did let demons spawn and wasn’t trying to defeat them or hide them... Incubators aren’t exactly neutral parties.  They want the work we do.  That’s the price for our wish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P234">But if they don’t need human emotion...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P235">She refused to speak, and the Incubator continued, unprompted.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P236">“There will be a point when if we can’t contract who we need to, this universe’s demise will be inevitable.  Is that <i>really</i> what you want?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P237">Cassandra gripped her left hand in her right, covering her soul gem as she felt herself grow uncomfortable, using the discomfort to steel herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P237">She hoped the bluff worked.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P236">“It isn’t what I want, but you <i>need</i> to follow my rules.  If you don’t… one of the moons can hold all the grief cubes instead.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P238">The Incubator turned its head askew, visibly confused.  It was a mannerism she’d seen it practice too many times to believe it genuine before now, spare the inexplicable show of emotions.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P236">“We never <i>will </i>understand your species, will we?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P239">After a sigh, she banished the Incubator, as it vanished with a <span>clap</span>, air rushing in to fill the space it had just occupied.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P239">“No.  No you never will.  I’ll make sure of it.”</p>

<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P241">She gingerly pushed the door to the practice room, and found herself in an open room roughly the size of a tennis court, <span>the floors smearing into walls with gentle curves smoothing over the edges.  </span>A tall ceiling revealed mirrors into what must’ve been observation rooms, as August realized in the center of the room was her sister, fighting a magical girl clad in yellow.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P242">Her siste<span>r</span><span> was </span>dodg<span>ing</span> the glancing attacks of the magical girl <span>with ease, </span><span>her aggressor lunging repeatedly</span>.  <span>The </span>yellow-clad magical girl, Jenna <span>Weaver, </span>August presumed, swung her broadsword with malice.  <span>Each failed </span><span>strike was followed by her</span> <span>immediately </span>yank<span>ing </span>it out of the concrete floor.  <span>Each time</span> debris <span>fell off of the magical blade, her head pivoting frantically as she tried to keep eyes on</span> June.  <span>Her sister wasn’t even using her </span><i>arms</i><span> yet.</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P243"><span>J</span><span>une’s</span> pink and purple sweater <span>had</span> <span>been </span>replaced with a lacy white and pink dress, the subtle theme of petals forming on the edge of the trim, <span>flowing </span><span>over a petticoat</span>.  Her simple s<span>neakers</span> replaced <span>underfoot </span>with ornate <span>but</span> functional heels, barely an inch off the ground <span>but distinctly color-matched to her dress</span>.   The <span>pink </span>bow <span>she’d had </span>in her hair <span>for what felt like years had been made </span>a white, <span>but her hair was where the biggest change was.  The</span> muted brown <span>locks</span> <span>she shared with her sister had </span>turned into a radiant pink, <span>held in the now-white bow in a high ponytail. Finally, a</span><span> stone, h</span><span>er </span><i>soul gem</i><span>, a faceted triangle was suspended on her sternum, lined with a gold accent.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P242">A scared look flashed on June’s face if for a moment, replaced quickly with determination as she began running towards the wall of the room as Jenna barreled after her, throwing smaller blades at her as she dodged them nimbly.  June didn’t quite escape unscathed though, getting the narrowest approximation of a haircut as a straight-bladed knife sailed over shoulder, slightly to the left of her ears as a few strands of pink hair fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P242">As she reached the wall, she heard Jenna yell as she lunged forward, June jumping up the wall and running <i>up</i> the embankment and vertically against the surface, Jenna’s broadsword firmly burying itself in the wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P242">Jenna surrendered as her weapon dissolved, and her magical girl regalia turned back into a loose tee and a tennis skirt.  Clapping, impressed, she retreated as June landed near the far edge of the room, feigning a bow.  In an instant, she noticed her sister watching the encounter starry-eyed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“August!  Oh gosh I missed you so much!” she gleefully bellowed as she transformed back into her less <i>period</i> attire, sprinting across the room fast enough to cause a breeze behind her.  As she leapt into a bear hug, August yelped, the girl releasing her just as quickly as she’d hugged her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“Ow…” she mumbled, August wincing as she spoke.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P245">Right.  I’m stronger now, this is going to take getting used to...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“Can we talk about-” August began, pointing at her sister’s hair, mousy brown roots taking hold in place of her sister’s chocolate-tone hair.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">June shook her head gently.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“Can we talk about it later? I know you have questions, but I think a lot of them are gonna be answered when Karina gets here.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">August couldn’t help but surrender in the moment.  June usually <i>did</i> get her way, despite her best efforts.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“I think you should sit down on the bench or something.  Minimizes the risk of you getting hurt.” her sister declared, August perturbed at her sister’s insights being so casually shared when she’d been so reticent to share them before.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“Hm… okay…” August mumbled, brushing dust off of the bench before sitting down gingerly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P246">I’d think most spectators go to the observation room, further from the action.  It’s probably just basic stuff for now, given that I’m still here. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P247">June stood awkwardly in the middle of the room as she waited for Karina to enter, Jenna walking into the locker room after her small encounter with June.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P247"><span>As she idly looked </span><span>around at</span><span> the room, </span><span>June</span><span> found herself </span><span>quickly </span><span>drawn to the sound of glass breaking.</span> <span>Karina yell</span><span>ed</span><span> as she crashed through the observation room window towards her, June</span> instinctually transform<span>ing </span><span>as she registered that </span><span>Karina’s spear was aimed </span><i>right at her </i><span>and approaching quickly.</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P248">She fixed her footing <span>to brace herself quickly, </span><span>eyes determined as she </span><span>summon</span><span>ed a </span><span>glowing </span><span>pink </span><span>disc of light.  </span><span>Karina </span><span>collided with the barrier, glass shards </span><span>moments behind her as they both hit the barrier in an instant.  Her spear had shattered against it, the spearhead and staff going in opposite directions, </span><span>as the glass hung half-suspended in the barrier, Karina’s heel embedded in the glowing shield the same way.</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P248"><span>Karina stared at June for a moment, her face </span><span>showing determination more than anything else</span><span>, a look she didn’t expect on a </span><i>rookie.</i></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P249">She took to this quick.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P250">As the thought registered, June shifted the barrier and Karina slid off, falling onto her back.  As Karina collected herself off the ground, knocking dust off of her dress as her spear, still laying wayward, vanished into a pile of sparkles.  June dropped the barrier, the jagged shards of glass clattering onto the concrete floor, both girls unharmed but one feeling immensely undignified.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P251">Karina’s stance shifted, June summoning two more glowing discs, roughly over her palms as she took blow after blow from her mentor.  Each punch, each kick, met as quickly as she threw them as she shrugged each blow off.  The glowing discs seemed to absorb each impact, slowing her attacker down.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P251">Karina backed away from June, realization dawning on her face that she<i> had</i> to change strategies as she re-materialized her weapon of choice behind her.  Dozens of javelins floated mid-air, June’s eyes following her <i>opponent’</i><i>s </i>actions carefully.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P252">Karina’s gaze remained locked on June as she summoned even more spears, their orbit whipped to a fervor as one by one they lurched at her.  June shattered the the tips with ease, splitting the next barrage cleanly with the edge of a disc as easily as if she were chopping vegetables.  As the storm of sharps finally thinned out, she took the chance to leap vertically from the center of the room, rebounding off of a platform she summoned, aimed back <i>at Karina</i> and hit her mentor square in the shoulder with a glowing sphere around her fist. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P253">A psychic boxing glove.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P252">Her sister watched, jaw agape as Karina tapped out, June’s barriers dropping instantly, taking the chance to stretch and relax.  She hadn’t expected to fight Karina <i>right after</i> she’d fought Lt. Weaver.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“So you’re a barrier generator.” Karina sighed, June nodding expectantly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P254">“Yeah.  You <i>knew that!” </i>she exclaimed, sulking to herself as Karina stretched more.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P255">She followed through and tried to kill me with her spear!  So much for the joke! </p>
<p class="paragraph-P256">“Yeah well, I needed to make sure you knew how to use it since you didn’t even try against Jenna.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“I didn’t <i>need to!</i>”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P244">The two of them paused for a moment <span>as they noticed</span> August sobbing quietly <span>on the bench, </span>both walk<span>ing</span> over to her <span>gingerly</span>. Karina un-transform<span>ed into a pair of slacks and a sleeveless sweater, her hair in a </span><span>clip</span><span> </span><span>as she sat down next to August</span><span>.  J</span>une failed to <span>transform back</span>, <span>forgetting her attire</span><span> as she</span> h<span>eld </span>her sister close, <span>her sister’s snot-nosed sniffling overwhelmed by the scent of summer radiating off of her sister’s floral attire</span><span>.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“Junebug, you… you’re so-so-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">“I know I know.  Dad would have <i>hated it.”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P244">August laughed through the tears, wiping her eyes on the sweater.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P257">“Ugh, sorry Luhr-sama.” she offered, Karina attempting to disarm the situation.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P258">“Don’t worry, I have like twenty of those sweaters.  Shannon wore the same thing every day basically.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P259">June gave her a confusing look, absentmindedly thinking “<i>What the hell?” </i>to herself as Karina responded mentally.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P260"><i>Listen, she like</i><i>d</i><i> </i><i>consistency</i><i>.</i> </p>
<p class="paragraph-P260">June jumped slightly, realizing she’d just <i>telepathically</i> talked to the other girl.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P261">Get used to it, it happens a lot more than you’d think.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P262">Ugh.  Fine.  Still less bad than when the Incubator did it… that just made my skin crawl.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P263"><i>Me too June, me too</i>.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P256">“<span>Your </span><span>sister fights </span><span>dirty</span><span> August, did you teach her all that?”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P264">“As if…” she mumbled, trying to not think about the last twenty four hours.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P264">“We both learned to fight a bit after the world got cut off… People got desperate.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P265">August just nodded a bit, staring at the ring on her sister’s hand, her costume dissolving as she was back the duochromatic sweater August caught only a glimpse of between her sparring with Jenna and Karina.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P266">“Your soul gem…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P266">“I need some grief cubes but I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P266">“You put up <i>way more</i> of a fight than I expected though, what the hell?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P266">“I’m a shield, remember?  Most people just can’t form a shield inside of other matter, or push and pull it like it’s a tablecloth.” she laughed, August realizing something with dread.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">Her sister was <i>happier.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">Karina noticed the look on August’s face, and shrunk slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">“I think you two have a lot to talk about.  I didn’t expect the sparring to go as <i>quickly</i> as little miss menace made it, so… you’ve got a little more time to chat.” Karina admitted before recusing herself, leaving August and June alone for the first time since the train.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">“So… I guess it’s time to talk about it.” June mumbled, her demeanor the same melancholia that August had grown to know so well.  She sat on the bench next to her sister, trying to hold her sister’s hand as she pulled it back.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">“I… I really didn’t want you to contract Junie.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">“I know, I know, <i>I know.</i>” she muttered, holding her head in her hands.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P267">“You clearly didn’t!” August yelled, June shrinking slightly.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P268">“You made a wish and sold your soul to that little rat-devil!” she yelled, June unable to help smiling a little bit.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P268">“Okay that’s fair actually, but-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P268">“We’re trapped in this tiny reality bubble, and you went ahead and<i> sacrificed yourself</i> for some stupid fight!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P269">“It’s not stupid!  The Ceph are a real threat!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P268">“We haven’t <i>seen</i> any Ceph in here, have we?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P268">“I… no.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P270">“Then what are you<i> fighting? </i> What the hell was your reason to make a damned wish?  What even was it‽” she sobbed, each word more difficult to choke out than the last.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P269">“You.  I contracted for you.” June muttered under her breath, so quiet she was pretty sure August couldn’t hear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">She heard.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“Why.” she mumbled, holding her sister’s hand, so gingerly she could barely feel her touch.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“You protected me for so long August… I didn’t want to depend on you forever.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“I would have let you.” August admitted, her voice a whisper.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“How is that fair to you?” June responded, tears welling in her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“Besides… that’s only half of it, if I’m being honest.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P271">“<span>H</span><span>alf.  What’s the other half?  I hope it’s a lot more justified.” </span><span>August</span><span> </span><span>snorted</span><span>, trying to keep herself together, at the </span><i>absurdity</i><span> of what was so </span><i>clearly</i><span> a done deal.  </span><span>Incubators didn’t exactly renege on contracts.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“I… I needed to protect you. From others.  You’re <i>too kind</i>.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P271">“<span>I don’t need your </span><i>protection! </i><span>How does that even make </span><i>sense?</i><span>  When people were shitty, I protected you.   </span><span>W</span><span>hen </span><span>the </span><span>Kisaki family </span><span>tried to go after Mom and Dad, </span><i>I </i><span>hauled your butt out of that burning building!” </span><span>August fumed, June’s expression unparsable and distant.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“And when Seika taunted you for months on end, do you know why it stopped?” she said, her affect flat and controlled.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“Because she got bored of her favorite punching bag?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P271">“Because I <i>made her</i>, August.  It was me, a golf club, and an after-school club meeting.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P271">“<span>You </span><span>couldn’t</span><span>-”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P272">“I didn’t hurt her physically, but I got the point across.” June said plainly, eyes, ordinarily mirthful, the brilliant pink catching the light of the room, looking at anything but her sister. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P273">August stared at her in disbelief, struggling to grasp just <i>how much </i>she had been shielded from.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P273">“You may have been my protector, but I was your shield too.  You just didn’t know.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P274">August jaw was agape as her sister got up, her soul gem cloudier than it had been at the start of the conversation.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P274">“I’m a barrier generator because my wish was to protect you.  <span>A</span>s long as I’m still standing and able to fight, I fight to keep you safe.  Remember that.”</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P275">August said nothing, <i>could say nothing</i>.  How could she respond?</div>
<p class="paragraph-P274">“I’ll be back after my mission.  Don’t go dying until I get back, okay?” she smiled, August looking up at her, her face despondent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P274">“Same to you, Junebug.” she muttered through a feigned smile, her joy dropping off as soon as her sister turned the corner.</p>

<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P279">She took a deep breath, and unlocked the door to her bedroom, stepping in quickly, and locking it behind her.  Her sapphire-colored eyes glimmering slightly in the <span>dim lighting of the room, </span>a voice called to her from a bed in the center, <span>canopy obscuring the figure within.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“Andrea, is that you?” the voice beckoned, as the girl took careful steps forward, her heels quiet on the low pile carpet.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“Yeah Mom, it’s me.” she smiled, the figure in the bed turning to face her, each move deliberate as Andrea felt her sense of self, her memory, stripped further and further back.  As the woman on the bed parted the mesh, Andrea felt her career, her past, her memories washed away, as she called for her mother.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P280">With <span>empty, deep-set </span>eyes <span>the color of sea-glass</span>, Itsumi Kisaki looked at her daughter, and through her.  <span>Andrea</span><span> found </span><span>her mother’s eyes </span><span>vacant, </span><span>disconcertingly so.  </span><span>She had been this way for </span><span>weeks, months even,</span><span> but it’d felt like an eternity.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P280">Her thoughts and memories were barely coherent, the future and past strewn about in a massive tangle of memories, even to her own daughter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“I had that dream again.  Of a little world suspended by a thread.” Itsumi mumbled, her hands spinning mid-air as if reeling the earth closer to the canopy’s peak.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“I know Mom, it’s a beautiful dream.” Andrea cooed, her soul gem on her hand growing darker by the moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“And the girl… Cassandra…” Itsumi muttered, looking up at her daughter as Andrea held her mother’s head close.  Andrea took a deep breath, tears hitting her mother’s blue-gray locks, still frizzy and tangled.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“Cassandra will be fine Mom, she’s a strong girl.” Andrea said softly, her mother’s face wracked with anguish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P279">“I don’t think so sweetie...  I keep seeing gunfire.  Explosions, nightmares.  White serpents with golden rings, and so, so much pain.” she mumbled, each word dragging her closer to what Andrea felt was fear, her own mind clouding more by the moment.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P281">Focus on the reason you’re here.  Focus on June and August.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P282">Andrea yielded, her mother looking at her with weary eyes still, as she sat down on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P282">“Hey Mom… Stephanie found two more members of the family.” she said plainly, unable to meet her mother’s eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P282">“Oh?” Itsumi beamed, more mentally present if for a moment.  “Who are they, tell me more!  Did your brother finally remarry?” she probed, each with more intensity than the last.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P282">“August and June.  They were adopted into the family, but one just contracted, a powerful magical girl.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P282">“Another magical girl!  Finally someone to give you a run for your money, eh?” the matriarch prodded, Andrea’s smile pacifying, knowing that her younger sister already showing her up plenty in the years prior.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P283">So she doesn’t remember Mae… Marion… even Madison!  Good Goddess, her state is getting worse…</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P284">Andrea couldn’t help but notice the decomposing bodies of Marion and Madison on the far side of the bed, soul gems shattered.  <span>The stench </span><span>of the corpses </span><span>was </span><i>nauseating</i><span>, but she ignored it as best she could.  She </span><i>had to.</i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P285">“I hope not…” Andrea muttered under her breath, her facade of authority waning.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P286">Who am I trying to put a brave face on for anyways?  Not sure Mom will notice.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P282">“Well, no matter what, just don’t trust what Akemi-san has to say about <span>those girls</span>.  That girl is <i>wretched</i>.  A liar, a thief.  Stole her from all of us.” she muttered, <span>eyes rolling back in her head as she </span><span>collapsed into a</span><span> mountain of pillows.  </span><span>Andrea</span> <span>couldn’t help but hold </span>her hand <span>for a moment before getting up</span>.</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P287"><span>Andrea</span> <span>quietly hummed a melody</span>, <span>opening </span>the nightstand <span>drawer with practiced motions as a small pile of grief cubes enveloped her mother’s soul gem.  Glancing down at her own, she </span><span>pulled out a few unused cubes.  The saturated grief cubes were slid into the magic p</span>ocket of her dress, <span>holding two</span><span> more</span><span> </span><span>t</span><span>o her own </span><span>soul gem </span><span>while waiting </span><span>as she observed Itsumi’s grow clearer by the moment.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P288">After what felt like an eternity, Andrea took a deep breath, steeling herself.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P289">“<span>I know Mom, I know… </span>I’ll protect you.  I always will…” <span>she whispered, her eyes </span><span>glimmering</span><span>.  She </span><i>had</i><span> to have faith.  </span><span>The alternative left her mother without a daughter, after all.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P287">Andrea got up, gingerly sliding the saturated grief cubes into the pocket of her dress, looking at her mother with regret in her eyes.  Itsumi was already beginning to drift in her dream-state as Andrea was overwhelmed her mother’s nightmares, committed to her mind telepathically.  Andrea recoiled as the emotions flowed over and through her, her throat tightening involuntarily, wishing she could scream.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P290">Help me, Shannon, please!  Help me!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P291">Andrea lurched towards the door in terror, falling onto the carpet, doubled over in pain.  With pained motions, she crawled towards the door and away from her mother’s psychic damage.  Andrea’s body finally relaxed as parts of her psyche relented, years of experiences flooding back in a rush.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P292">“Don’t… do it… Cassandra…” Itsumi mumbled, her voice barely audible as her daughter picked herself off the ground.  If Andrea was concerned over her own inexplicable collapse, she didn’t seem to act on it.  The agony gone as quickly as it’d arrived, as with the memories carried on the suffering.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P287">With wincing steps, she walked over to the nightstand and carefully wound a music box.  Admiring the gentle chimes for a moment, she paused, then headed for the door.  At the threshold, she couldn’t help but glance back at her resting mother.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P290">I hope we find someone to help you soon.  I can’t bear to put you out of your misery.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P293">She exited the room to find a bearded fellow, a spitting anachronism of a 21<span>st</span> century doctor, staring back at her.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“Craig.” she said firmly, the man’s emotions indomitable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“Andrea.” he grunted half-heartedly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“Any changes I missed?” she said, Craig’s demeanor carrying a disconnected calm that, at times, made her want to scream.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“Not really, no.  She’s effectively on house-arrest, same as always… and I don’t normally do house calls.” he said, his voice souring.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">“And she’s still going off about her nightmares?” Andrea meekly pressed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P294">“When she speaks at all.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“It’s times like these I wish my mother wasn’t a telepath…” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">Craig nodded knowingly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“Unfortunately… we both know that’s not how it works.  Older magical girls developing related powers is to be expected past a certain age...”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“And no one else can help her?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P295">“The last one who tried is <i>still in a coma.</i>  Besides, she just swore off the <i>only</i> magical girl who could help, if history is any indication.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P296">Andrea’s face lit up, utter astonishment catching her off guard.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P297">“History” she began, her mind recalled to New Athens in an instant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P297">“Surely you don’t mean-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P298">Craig leaned in, his voice barely a whisper, but unmistakably relieved.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“She showed up in my infirmary before collapsing, Andrea.  Akemi Homura is <i>here</i>.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">Andrea shook slightly as she sat down on the seat outside her mother’s bedroom, Craig joining her with a solemn look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“How soon can I-”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P299">“<span>S</span><span>he’</span><span>s</span><span> on Galileo, Andrea, but I don’t know where </span><span>now</span><span>.”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P299">“How could you-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P299">“I don’t know she did it, but she <i>vanished.</i>  One moment she was asleep in the infirmary, the next she had me by the collar suspended mid-air demanding her ribbon.  The moment after she’d disappeared.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“How could she disappear, you had cameras-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“I mean she <i>literally vanished</i> Andrea.  It was like she was teleporting.” he opined, Andrea’s eyes narrowing as she reviewed the conversation in her head, recalling her mother’s words as if a distant memory.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“Any chance you can get me a copy of the footage?” she asked, her request shifting unapologetically into demand mid-syllable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“I’m not sure it’ll do any good, but I’ll have someone bring it over.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“You can’t just… send me a copy digitally?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P293">“Not with Cassandra holding Governance AIs hostage, no…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P300">Andrea grumbled.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P300">“Guess I’ve got to take up the cult’s mission too.” <span>she murmured to no one in particular, </span><span>Riddel’s bushy eyebrows raised incredulously. </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P300">“You’re going to find her?”  Craig asked, his voice riddled with doubt.  “Need I remind you she tried to <i>kill me</i> for giving her <i>medical treatment</i>?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P301">“What choice do I have?  It’s <i>that</i> or we all die in this bubble.” she said curtly, excusing herself and headed for the elevator bank. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P302">Dr. Riddel was left alone in the hallway on a comfortable but deeply unexpected Ottoman bench.  As his back gently slumped into the wall, he tried to ignore the sound. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P303"><span>Sitting a</span>cross from him was an artist’s rendition of the scene he walked by on his way to the infirmary every morning, the Goddess’ suspension of the Earth, spare one difference.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P304">The sound permeated the wall behind him, a waning matriarch singing a siren’s song as nightmares flowed out of her like a vile ichor.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P305"><span>In the </span><span>ornate </span><span>frame, </span>Akemi Homura was next to her Goddess, supporting her gentle touch holding the Earth on the left panel of the triptych, acting as her adjudicator by arrow-point in the right pane.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P306">As Craig’s ears betrayed him, transferring the matriarch’s wails to his conscious mind, he stood up and headed towards the elevator with haste, glancing back only once at the artwork.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P309">It’s a little different when you’re this close.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Hey.” said a voice behind her, turning to find herself looking at Karina.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“How you holding up?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“I… I’m okay, I think.” June admitted, still reeling from her last chat with her sister.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“It was like, what.  Five minutes total?” she broached, June’s face weary.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Must’ve been bad huh…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“I… I don’t want to talk about it right now.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">Karina crossed her arms, head hung slightly as she stewed on what to say.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P311"><span>I w</span>as never good at this part… ugh.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Okay.” she opined, “but I’ll be here if you need to.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">June nodded faintly as Karina glanced up, finding herself drawn to June’s crown, worry on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Hey June...” Karina opened again, June half-expectantly turning away.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“I said I don’t want to talk about it right now.” she hissed, as Karina shook her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“No, not that.  Your <i>hair.</i>  It’s pinker.” she said plainly, June gasping slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Like when I transform… yeah I saw.  <i>J</i><i>ust </i>when I’m transformed, right...?” she sputtered, her voice carrying disbelief with ease.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“No, no, I mean… the roots of your hair <i>now</i> are pink.” she admitted, the ambient lighting of the gallery sending her reeling as she struggled to look at it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Where’s the-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Bathroom is next to the infirmary.  Across the hall.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Thank you-” she yelped, sprinting across the hall with agitation.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">The door swung wildly on hinges as Karina opened the door gingerly, her understudy absorbed by her own reflection as she yanked one of her own hairs out, peering at it as though it held the secrets to the universe.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“I...I thought magical girls just have fancy hair all the time.  Not that it’s the <i>magic</i> doing it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Some get to keep their hair, some it changes.  Nobody is quite sure why.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Ugh, it was some stupid wish like five thousand years ago, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Hah, that’s the theory.  Besides, if you <i>really</i> get annoyed you can “heal yourself” to change it back.  If it’s incongruent, it’s something you can fix.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“The body is so strange…” June mumbled to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Yeah, tell me about it.  I didn’t expect to be able to move a transporter with my bare hands, and now I have to be careful to not break more door locks.” Karina admitted, June laughing slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“So… do you think you’re going to change it?” Karina asked, fiddling absentmindedly with her own hair, if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“I… I don’t think so, no.  If it grows out pink, it grows out pink.” she admitted, a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“That’s the spirit.” Karina beamed, the two leaving the bathroom together, much to Ophelia’s dismay as she shot the girls a dirty look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“What were you <i>doing?”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P312">“June’s hair got power-bleached and she was a little worried.” Karina surrendered, June irate she’d volunteered her panic so easily.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P309">What!?  She’s my CO!  I have to tell her stuff!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Ugh, fine.” June grumbled, before Ophelia looked at her softly.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P310">“It’s fine kid. I get it.  Do you think I wanted my hair to look like seaweed?” she laughed, the smile betraying her tone.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P313">June found herself focusing on the magical girl’s enunciation, her familial background unplaceable.  It was… odd.  Out of place.  She caught herself, realizing in an instant what it was.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P314"><i>Ophelia</i><i> soun</i><i>ds</i><i> old.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Besides.  As it grows out, it’ll look more and more appropriate.  The annoying change was the eyebrows, that I <i>did</i> change on purpose.” Ophelia confessed, fiddling with her moss-colored curls.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P310">“Ack!  I didn’t even <i>think </i>about my eyebrows<i>!” </i>June balked, before dashing back into the bathroom, Karina and Ophelia sharing a laugh for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P309">Power-bleaching isn’t super common these days… feels like a relic from the past.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P309">These girls feel like anachronisms in more ways than one.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P309">Yeah, me too.  Something changed when we got stuck in this bubble universe, and I’m not sure I like it.  We gotta make sure her wish is her own if she ever does contract.  Otherwise the Incubators might use it to play dirty.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P319">“Jenna.  My name is <i>Jenna.</i> What is it with your family and being formal, we’ve got bigger issues to worry about right now, I swear...” she balked, her eyes rolling as she trailed off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“My family…” August mumbled to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Right.  Your sister, June.  She did the same thing before she let me kick my own ass!” she laughed, August cracking a smile through her dread as the realization hit her.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P319">“She- you’re the magical girl from the practice room!” <span>she exclaimed, Jenna laughing, her face far less angry when she wasn’t swinging a broadsword with verve.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Same one, well, mostly the same one; healed up already but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t frustrating.” she laughed, walking towards the entrance as August stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“She didn’t even use her hands… what type of rookie does that…” she muttered to herself, turning around to find August looking at her expectantly.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P319">“Ms. Weaver, I was told I need an escort to go back to Karina’s home.  Since I can’t go on the mission, can you help me get back?”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P319">She shook her head awkwardly, her posture shifting slightly as she realized awkwardly that she couldn’t, even if she <i>wanted</i> to.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Sorry August, I’ve got to go the briefing.  We’re having it old-fashioned-like given the infrastructure falling apart.  Plus, Ophelia is being paranoid.” she prattled off, August all the more curious.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P319">“Ophelia?”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Lt. Kagari?  Karina’s CO?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“<i>Ah.</i>” August mumbled, realizing she hadn’t actually known her name yet.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P320">The silence hung in the air, despite the filtration finally being back on, before Jenna took the chance to excuse herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P321">“Well… I’ll catch you later.  Don’t get into trouble, okay?” she smiled, a warm, radiant smile she’d clearly performed countless times.  August’s face contorted if for a moment, downright insulted, before managing to produce a feeble smile in response.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“I’ll try.” August let out, as Jenna disappeared into the conference room, before poking her head back out and walking back towards the ordinary human girl in front of her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“One more thing…” she said quietly, pulling August a little closer, as if to share a secret.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P319">“Go easy on yourself, okay?  You’ve been through a lot?” she insisted, August ignoring it as best she could.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P318">Easy for you to say.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P322">“I… I’ll try.” she admitted truthfully, before a realization hit her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P323">“Oh, if I wanted to learn how guns and stuff worked… do you think I could make use of the firing range, or if I can even use it…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Jeez, going right for, well… the big guns I guess.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Not if I can help it.” August said through a thin smile, Jenna laughing at the response.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Smart.  I think Harmony is in the range, right?” Jenna inquired as Karina walked past August on the far side of her vision, the girl jumping at the movement.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P319">“Jeez, August.  <i>Relax!</i> I wasn’t even moving quick, I was just… walking.” she smiled, August feeling her anger rise at how <i>little </i>she seemed to notice her fury.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P324">She saw me arguing with June earlier!  What’s with her politeness now?  That’s so fucked up!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P325">“But to answer your question, <i>Lt. Weaver</i>,” Karina emphasized, Jenna rolling her eyes as she did so, “Lt. Stephens should be at the firing range.  I believe her and Mr. Paris should be down there, and either of them can show you the ropes.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P325">“So I can go learn how to shoot an actual <i>good</i> gun?” August asked with a blasé tone as Karina nodded.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P325">“Karina, could I get a set of keys to the house, on the off chance someone here can get me back to it while you’re on mission?” August asked, her voice distant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P325">“Uh…” Karina shrugged, “I think it should let you in?  You don’t need a key, I don’t think.  Biometric locks have been standard for a while.  Besides, I don’t usually lock it…” she admitted, scratching her head awkwardly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P325">“Thanks.” she muttered, as the magical girls went back into the conference room for their meeting.  August kept pacing in the halls, between the </p>
<p class="paragraph-P326">What ever happened to that girl being easy on herself?</p>

<div class="paragraph-P327">Craig Riddel, personal dictation.  It’s August 26<span>th</span>, 2460.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P327">While other members of the Kisaki family taken on as patients tended to exhibit strong coincidence with contracting, there seems to be some nurturing element present as well with the latest set.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P327">Past Governance policies among the core worlds insisted on maintaining parts of the human condition, but what does it mean to be human in a world without death, without disease, without the things that defined the magical girls of our shared history?  If there is an answer, it hasn’t yet percolated to me, and I suspect it never will.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P327">More to the point, June Kisaki exhibits incredibly competent magic well in excess of her contract duration.  This remains true even when adjusted for age and background, much to the chagrin of Lt. Kagari.  Further understanding of her upbringing, as well as that of her sister, may prove necessary to mitigate the fallout of future missions that may endanger her mind and body alike.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P328">The more powerful they are from the get-go, the more hubris tends to be their downfall.  I can’t bear to think of what would happen to August if June died in combat.  This isn’t Mitakihara, we don’t have cloning tanks.  The dead stay dead here, so she’s got to stay on our side of that cosmic divide.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P328">For all our sakes.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P327"><span>June</span><span> walked into the room, her demeanor a far cry from the girl Karina had taken in a day prior;  She had a chip on her shoulder despite the circumstances.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“June, thanks for showing up.” Karina opened, glancing sideways at Jenna as she nodded knowing, fiddling with her hair in wait.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">June couldn’t help but smile a bit.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P329">“It’s my first real mission. I’m… excited, nervous?  Both?” she prattled off, Karina <span>making an amused hum.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“I’d imagine both.  Normally, we’d expect you to do a <i>little more training</i> but it’d still be a far cry from a mere hour or two of practice.” Ophelia admitted, Karina rolling her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“Yeah.  Three, four days <i>maybe.” </i>she sputtered, thinking not-so-fondly of her time at basic on New Athens.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P330">“Karina.” Ophelia spat, glaring daggers at her peer, Karina reclining in her chair slightly, her hands cupping the armrests gently.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“More to the point though, you did well enough to hold your own against these two, and you know their limitations fairly well.” Ophelia admitted, June’s face growing redder at the praise.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“I… think so?  Maybe not…” June shyly mumbled, Ophelia dismissing the embarrassment as well as she could from across the room with a wave.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“You didn’t even use your magic directly when fighting Jenna!  You didn’t even break a sweat!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“Well, at least one…” June mumbled, Karina snickering to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“If it’s any consolation, this mission is focused on intelligence gathering.  Depending on the intel, maybe a bit of capture the flag<i>.” </i>Ophelia said plainly, her tone optimistic towards the end.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“Like… war game type stuff?” June poised, Jenna and Karina nodding at her question.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“Yes, precisely!” Ophelia nodded, the other girls nodding at her to continue, Karina’s leg shaking under the table as the presentation continued.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“So, pardon the informality of this all, but we’re dealing with some deeply fucked consequences since we lost Halley and Brahm.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P329">“The colony computers?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P329">“<span>The </span><i>Governance</i><i> </i><i>AIs</i><span>, yes.” Ophelia responded coolly, emphasis on vernacular clearly pervasive.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P331">“We know that Itsumi’s matriarchy has been trying to gather more power locally in pursuit of… something.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P331">“They’ve been snooping around lately, poking at a door here, eavesdropping there.  Hell, they’re already snooping at <i>you and your sister.” </i>Karina said through a scowl.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Wait, who? How?” June balked, glancing sideways at her peers.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Well, you <i>met her</i>.  Stephanie is a Kisaki.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“She married in recently” offered Jenna, “much to Karina’s chagrin.”, Lt. Luhr’s expression growing red as she gripped the armrests tighter, the plush covering nearly tearing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“She <i>did </i>call you a puta I guess…<i>” </i>June muttered half-heartedly as Ophelia’s cool facade flickered into rage, if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P333">“Of course she did.  Figures.” Karina fumed, Jenna’s laughter cut short by a glance from Lt. Kagari.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“More to the point though, they’ve been collecting power and not doing much with it.  It’s strange.  So… I think there’s someone <i>else</i> in play here, another magical girl or two.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Why?” June asked, half-raising her hand mid-way through asking, confidence faltering as Karina raised an eyebrow to Kagari.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P334">“Okay so-” Karina opened, her leg continuing to shake, “ignoring tabulation issues or whatever, the number of petty non-violent crimes dropped like a rock all of a sudden two days after the bubble formed.  Crimes of that category aren’t generally an issue here <i>anyways, </i><i>but it was global.  </i>Localized in our region, maybe, but it was observable globally.<i>”</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P334">“The really <i>odd</i><i> </i>thing was that what replaced it was intentional and precise attacks.” Ophelia continued, Jenna grabbing at her forearm, the scar faintly visible.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Attacks?  Did they….” June opened, Ophelia nodding grimly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Two members of the matriarchy are missing, at a minimum, and another magical girl was witnessed being assassinated.  Why coordinate power and then kill your own magical girls?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Assassinated?<i> What?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“They shattered her soul gem.  On purpose.” Karina stated, the armrest of the chair still buckled from her iron grip minutes prior, as Ophelia not so subtly told her mentally to stop.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P335">Karina, please stop destroying the office furniture.  I know it’s a mess here but still.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P335">They fucking killed a girl!  Why should I calm down‽  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P336">Because it might kill you?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P336">Ugh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“What the hell, WHY?” June spat, her frustration growing as she ran her fingers through her curls, failing to soothe herself.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P332">“The Incubator<span>s</span> suspect it’s related to our “<span>i</span>ncomprehensible and unobservable faith.”” <span>Karina said through </span><span>a</span><span> shrill imitation of the Incubator’s tone.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“They killed her that way… so she wouldn’t see the Law of Cycles?  That’s so awful…” June sputtered, her eyes welling at the thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“We can’t really think of any other reason to so intentionally target a girl’s soul gem…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P337">Silence hung in the air of the small conference room, the medical wing visible behind them through the glass window as the girls glanced towards it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“At least they died instantly…” Jenna mumbled, not sure how much she believed the silver lining herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P337">June steeled herself and wiped her teared eyes clean, sniffling slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“But… this was an intelligence briefing, right?  I’m not prepped for taking down assassins or anything!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P338">“Ah, sorry.  Got a bit derailed.” Ophelia admitted nervously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P339">This happens sometimes.  She’s got so much on her mind that despite best efforts, she’s still scatterbrained.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P339">In combat though, she’s as sharp as a knife though.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P338">“To try and cut a very long story short, when they to gain power, they stole the two Governance AIs responsible for most of colony operation.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“That’d be Halley and Brahm.  While ostensibly a lot of the planet is running automatically, <i>some things</i>, high bandwidth and high cognition planning for example, are totally offline.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Which is why we’re doing an actual briefing and not just sending the sit-rep mentally.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P340">June paused for a moment, cradling her chin as she was deep in thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P341">“Okay…. So the planning computers got killed, or kidnapped, or something.  We’re rescuing them?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Oh no, absolutely not.  We have <i>zero idea</i> what to expect if we go and try to break in to a criminal syndicate stronghold, co-opted by magical girls.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“So then what are we actually <i>doing?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Galileo, the first AI that Governance had for our little rock, is still unaccounted for.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">June’s ears perked at the mention, her eyes growing wide before being drowned in melancholy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“I… Galileo tutored my sister.  We gotta bring her along, let her help somehow!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“June…” Karina offered softly, holding the girl’s hand.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“We’re taking a risk even looking for Galileo, we’re not sure they’re alive.  If it wouldn’t give us back eyes and ears, we wouldn’t even be considering it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“So not a word of this to your sister until the mission is over, got it?” June nodding solemnly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“So… what’s the plan then?” Jenna asked, June drawn away from her sister for a moment, as the group refocused.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P342">“We’ll go above ground for a decent part of the journey, potentially while shielded, if you can manage it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P342">“I can.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P342">“About a half kilometer from the city limits, we’ll hop on to the train and do some “light renovations.”” Karina grinned, a devilish look in her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P343">June shook her head for a moment, another lingering question drawn to the surface.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“One more question.  Why <i>are</i> there so many subway tunnels anyways?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Turns out-” Karina coughed, “Galileo has a fondness for the rail infrastructure of the 20th and 21st century Earth.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Well, I hope they’re not too mad we’re playing with their trainset then.” June smiled, the girls giddy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P332">“Let’s do this.”</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P344"> <span>August</span><span> stomped down the concrete stairs, </span><span>her frustration carried</span><span> in each footfall.  As s</span><span>he</span><span> land</span><span>ed</span><span> on the last step, she heard shots being fired in the distance, </span><span>tensing involuntarily</span><span>, in an instant rela</span><span>xing afterwards.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P345">Right.  Gunfire at the range.  Makes sense.  August, get it together.  Chill…</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P346">As she turned the corner, she found herself face-to-face with a magical girl she’d recognized from her initial hold-up at the station with her sister.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P347">I guess this is Harmony.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P346">“Excuse me.” she piqued, between the fire of an uncharacteristically over-sized gun in the magical girl’s hands, her eyes focused on the targets, not that she needed it.  She seemed to hit each target with <i>ease.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Uh, excuse me?  Are you… Harmony?” August gulped, the girl giving her a glance for a moment, before continuing her target practice, stance ever so slightly corrected.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Uh… your name <i>is</i> Harmony, right? I didn’t mishear Karina?” August gulped nervously as the girl’s firing cadence paused for a moment, her voice flat as she stared at her targets.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Rings a bell.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Sorry, what?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P349">“I said-” she started, continuing her firing on interval, “it rings” – “a bell”,  each pause punctuated by another cluster of shots hitting multiple distant targets.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Ah... I guess that was a joke then.” August grimaced, the girl putting the gun in the holster in a fluid motion, before turning to face her.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P350">The magical girl pointed behind her, her firing paused as she pointed to a shelf labeled “PPE” haphazardly, putting the safety glasses over own.  <span>With a sigh, she took off the </span>slightly too big <span>safety glasses unceremoniously</span>, <span>grabbing a set that seemed much better suited for a</span><i> </i><span>girl of her age</span>, rather than an adult set.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P350">With undignified jabs as if cleaning her ears, the earplugs got inserted as the weapons fire was <i>significantly</i> quieter.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P351">I guess magical girls don’t need that type of thing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P352">Through the effectiveness of the earplugs, she stared at Harmony to read her lips, each word giving her pause.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“August, why are you <i>still here?  </i>I thought Karina would have ditched you by now.<i>” </i>she said, her tone growing cooler by the syllable August finding it difficult to shrink even more than she already had.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“I.. uh… She adopted me?  And my sister.  Oh, and my sister is a magical girl now.” August babbled, the girl’s stern look softening through a sigh.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Tough shit kid, happens to the worst of us.” she spat, her composure slipping if for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P353">“So… Why are you still here then?” she asked, unholstering her gun as August opened her mouth to respond to the woman, Lt. Stephens seemingly indifferent to her plea.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Well, if I’m not a magical girl, but I gotta do stuff <i>here</i>… then I gotta learn how to defend myself.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P348">“So you’re here for <span>firearms training.</span><i>”</i> <span>the girl said calmly, glancing back at August for a moment, </span><span>as if to inspect her visually for some great risk.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P348">“Uh… I was trying to, but I don’t think I can open the gun locker myself.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P353">“Gun locker?” she asked, her voice incredulous.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P353">“Is that… something I can use, or see, or something?” August asked, her left hand outstretched towards the girl mildly as she glanced down, pausing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P354">Right.  Not a magical girl.  No soul gem, no ring.  If I just give her mine she might just blow her hand off, and I really don’t wanna have to explain to Craig how she shattered her arm.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P355">“I don’t know why Karina thinks this is a <i>good idea.”</i> Harmony bemoaned, August taking the chance to try and change her mind, sparing her yet another awkward conversation with her host.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P355">“One less person to worry about?  Besides, it’s mandatory, right?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P355">“Well, you’re expected to do mandatory service, but… maybe we should go <span>talk this over with her.”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P356">“She’s still briefing June on that stupid mission.  Wait, why aren’t you getting briefed too?” August balked, her expression shifting to confusion as the girl turned away from her, scoffing with indignation.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P356">“I got briefed earlier.  This is my leisure time.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“You spend your leisure time… at the range?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“As opposed to...?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“I don’t know… music?  Art? Something other than the thing you’ve been doing in combat for a while?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“Do you want firearms training or <i>not</i>?” she grunted, August rolling her eyes slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P357">“I don’t.  I mean, I do!  But not really?  Not specifically, but it’s the best thing I can think of to not need to <i>depend</i> on June anymore.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P358">The magical girl’s expressions softened even more so, her voice’s coarse edges softened down, familiar.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P359">“Why does the idea of depending on someone freak you out so much?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">August froze mid-step and caught herself in the moments after, the words echoing in her mind as she struggled to summon an answer.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“How’s that oldest kid thing working out for you?” Harmony spat, August wincing at the thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“I thought you didn’t know my family?” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“I don’t.  But I know an older sister panic when I see one.” she said through a lopsided smile.  August shrugged it off as best she could, her would-be range instructor re-holstering her weapon in a flash as she leaned against the counter of the range, turned to face her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P361">Guess it’s kinetic therapy time.  I’m taking time off tomorrow for this, I swear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P362">“I uh… I don’t know.” August stumbled out, the girl listening intently.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P363">“For a long time I protected her, right?  And that was true, and then she contracted and it feels like who my sister is was totally ripped away.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“That’s common.  You read the guidebook for family members yet?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P360">“No, not yet..  I will later, promise!” August admitted reluctantly, harmony nodding along, ready for her to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“The thing is… the first time we talked after she.. y’know, she said some frankly mean stuff, about how she’d been protecting me this whole time.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“Well… had she been?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“Yes, well, I don’t know!  The thing was she didn’t even <i>ask</i>!  I didn’t need her protection!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“Did you ever ask her if she needed <i>your </i>protection<i>?</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“No, it’s–” August balked, the magical girl giving her a weary look as the rest of sentence died on her tongue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“August.  Chill out, please. Take a breath or five.” she chided, August nodding as she took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“One… two… three… four…. Five.” Harmony intoned, August surprised at her intentional cadence.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“I… didn’t expect you to actually count me out.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“It helps.” she nodded, gesturing for August to continue.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P365">“I… I guess it’s just that after seeing her effortlessly fight Jenna…  She didn’t even lift a <i>finger.</i>”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P365">“<span>I heard, she’s </span><i>good.</i><span>” Harmony admitted, the girl shooting </span><span>d</span><span>aggers in response before rolling her eyes.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P365"> “And then she fought Karina!  She made it seem so natural… I feel kinda useless in comparison.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“Would you have felt better if she tried to keep her protecting you a secret?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“No, of course not!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“What about hiding that she contracted?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“As if!  She’s a <i>terrible</i> liar.” August laughed as the girl across from her gripped the workbench, shaking her head in disbelief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">Harmony took a moment and collected her own thoughts, a clear countdown going in her mind as she steadied herself, August trying to relax.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P366">“August, why are you upset you got treated the way you treat others?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P367">Each word was a shock to August, as she continued her barrage.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P366">“She got to tell you on her terms, and tried to treat you with respect.  She showed you dignity and self-determination, and didn’t act a bit like a child.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“But she <i>is one!” </i>August fumed, the magical girl putting a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“And so are you.” Harmony said softly, August’s anger diffusing in an instant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P368">Neither girl said a thing for a moment, August lost in her own self-loathing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P364">“August… you and your sister are a lot alike, based on the little I’ve seen. It’s okay to depend on one another.  Let yourself be helped, please.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P369">August’s voice was barely audible, the magical girl’s hand slipping away from her as she hung her head in shame.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P370">Five, four, three, two, one, zero, ok, go.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P369">“Okay…” she said plainly, the magical girl’s demeanor settling to the cold fascia she’d seen when she first entered the range.  The emotional spending of the discussion was clearly weighing on her, her soul gem on her finger murkier than she’d seen on a magical girl in-person.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P371">After a moment, she continued, fiddling with her soul gem for a moment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P369">“You feeling better…?” she asked, August’s gaze looking past her, her gaze thoroughly decimating the targets at the far end of range.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P369">“Yeah, I guess?” she mumbled, as the girl smiled a toothy grin, hoping it’d convince the both of them sufficiently.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P369">“Would shooting some shit and feel better?” she beamed, as August’s eyes lit up.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P369">“Yes, absolutely.” she declared, as the magical girl unholstered her own gun to show her the basics, <span>not-so-subtly altering the settings to </span><i>not</i><span> </span><span>re-admit the girl to</span><span> Dr. Riddel’s office.  </span><span>Leland</span><span> Paris, glancing up from his desk to look at the girls at the range, began to compose a message.</span></div>

<div class="paragraph-P373"><span>August </span><span>didn’t see her sister leave with Lt. Weaver or Karina.  She wasn’t sure she could stand to </span><i>look at them</i><span> right now.  Despite her kinetically-assisted therapy session, she still felt downright </span><i>gross</i><span> about how much her sister had hid from her.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P374">Lying to me…did she lie Mom and Dad?  Hiding the truth and saying it’s to protect one another…</p>
<p class="paragraph-P375">Without a place at the MSY to call her own, spare the infirmary she’d hoped to avoid for a while, she sat in the entrance hall.  With the gallery chamber to her back, she found the bench seating only <i>marginally </i>more comfortable than the concrete seats that somehow counted as practice area accommodations.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P375">Resting on the concrete block, and with sun cascading down the stairs leading to the entry-hall, she began to doze off.  The blissful warmth was a welcome reprieve from the unshakable chill that seemed to hold a firm grip on the denizens that called the <i>Mahō Shōjo Yokai</i> home.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P375">August was woken from her daze by the sound of heels, to find a girl that looked, but undoubtedly wasn’t her age staring back at her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P376"><i>A</i><i>nother girl… wait, </i><i>she must be a </i><i>magical girl!  Maybe I can finally go sleep in </i><i>a </i><i>fucking </i><i>bed!</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P375">“Uh–” she sputtered, “excuse me?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P375">The girl paused and turned to face her, a few steps closer.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P377">She wore a flattering blue jumpsuit, a cerulean tee underneath it.  <span>H</span>er sapphire-shade hair <span>was </span>kept close in a low braid behind her, doubling back on itself <span>into a loop</span>.  <span>In the moment, s</span>he pushed her round <span>silver-framed </span>glasses up slightly, something August was absolutely sure she could get rid of if she wanted to in this age of marvels.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P378">Surely if not through technology then, through magic?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“Yes miss?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“You’re a magical girl, right?” August poised, the girl raising her left arm, her hand aimed at the girl.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P379">“<span>Uh, I’d think so.” she beamed, August growing more hopeful by the minute.</span>  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“Do you know Karina Luhr?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“Of course!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“Well, my sister and I are staying with her, but she contracted and I <i>didn’t</i>, and I was told under doctor’s orders I can’t go outside without a magical girl escort.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“Oh, that’s frustrating.  Craig is only doing what he thinks is best though so…” she said, her voice surprisingly devoid of patronization.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P379">“Well, if you by any chance knew where she lived, could you just walk me back to her place?  I only knew it through the tunnels and, well, that’s not something I’ve got keys to.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P377">The girl pondered for a moment, before nodding.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P377">“Absolutely, we’re neighbors.  Let me get one thing.” she said, heading back into the depths of the facility before sprinting back up the stairs.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P377">“Out of curiosity, what’d you forget?” August broached, the girl showing off a small figure of a crow.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P377">“It’s a gift for my mom.” she smiled warmly, August reaching over her shoulder and opening her bag.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P377">“I can-” she started, the magical girl effusive as she handed her the crow figure, plush and soft in her hand as she put it into her bag.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P377">“One less thing to carry” she smiled, pointing at the door with gusto.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P377">“Shall we go?” she queried, August nodding with jubilee.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">The two ascended the stairs while chattering, August more and more wrapped up in thoughts, each step drawing them out more.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“So, you and your sister are both orphans?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P381">Why the hell weren’t there any signs about Junebug having potential?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“Yeah.  We don’t know our birth family.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“A rarity in this day and age.” the girl mused, August nodding along.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P381">Why didn’t the Incubator contract me instead?  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“Well, we got adopted by the Kisakis.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P380">“Oh, by <span>Gracie and Marcio</span>?”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“Yeah, how’d you know?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“Word gets around.  Galileo-Mu is big but not <i>that</i> big.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P381">What can I do to help her?  Or will she dote on me forever while I grow older and she stays the same?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“So, what did you want to do before the world collapsed?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“Oh, I wanted to be an artist, I studied sculpture and portraiture.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“Oh that’s wonderful, have you seen the Gallery?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P382">I hate feeling like I’m expected to rely on others.  I can take care of myself given the chance, I swear...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“I’d hope I’d know my own workplace, ha!” she laughed, realization dawning on August’s face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“Wait, you were in the gallery when I visited with Karina, weren’t you!  She paused and was distracted.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“One and the same.” she said, embarrassed to be recognized for her work, if for a moment, through a sarcastic bow.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">“I guess my legacy precedes me.  Karina asked me to step out so you could chat in private.” she laughed, August still deep in thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P383">Andrea’s attention was seized by a purple smear several blocks over, barely visible against the haze of the setting sun.  Motion too fast to be anything other than a magical girl, or a squid, shuddering at the thought.  But if she didn’t recognize the magical girl, then it must be...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P384">Akemi.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P383">August continued her march, gazing downwards at the street, one foot after another as the thoughts swirled in her mind.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P385"><i>Can I force an Incubator to contract?  Can an Incubator revoke a contract?  What can I do to save her?  Even if she wasn’t a magical girl, we’d still be stuck in this stupid bubble, no twinkling stars in the distance, one sun.  This may as well be a terrarium for all we know… if the rest of the universe is still out there.  Not like there’s a differen</i><i>ce </i><i>right now, </i><i>stuck here, alone… Well, not that alone thanks to</i>—</div>
<p class="paragraph-P380">As August glanced up, she realized with a shock that the magical girl was gone, and she was standing between two fairly worn looking concrete buildings, windows long since removed.  The solar streetlamps had turned on just moments prior in the narrow street behind her, casting shadows onto the asphalt where the sun had yielded.  August gripped her bag more as her knees began to shake.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P386">She was <i>sure</i> something was amiss, <span>her fears confirmed as quickly </span>as she saw towering white figure<span>s</span>, skeletal and emaciated, <span>barely reaching the windows of the second story.  </span></div>

<div class="paragraph-P386"><span>They</span> <span>appear</span><span>ed to be “walking”</span><span> through the crevice between two buildings, </span><span>lumber</span><span>ing</span><span> further down the block </span><span>towards her. </span><span>Plaster-white skin as pockmarked as the concrete they seemed to glide over, their heads devoid of any semblance of hair.  Their uncanny complexion masked by</span><span> robes as worn as </span><span>ghostly as their</span><span> bodies.</span><span>  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P386">The faces of the apparitions laid enveloped in sharp distortion, jagged as though the world itself was struggling to accommodate some immense physical and technical feat.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P380">Demon spawns.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P381">Fuck.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P387">August glanced around, finding herself once again met with the beacon of a subway stop, evidently further along the line than she had been initially.  She barreled towards the station, panting heavily as she descended the stairs, the noise the demons produced faded ever so slightly, hearing the air crackling overhead, their shots fired above where she had been moments prior.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P388">She knew that they’d sensed her, and that she was in immeasurable danger.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P389">Fuck!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P388">Each step down the stairs brought her closer to what may very well be her only method of escape.  She didn’t have time to think it through, she had to hope that the station was deep enough to keep them at bay for a little bit.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P391">As she found herself on the platform, she collapsed onto the floor, <span>her back resting </span>against signage.  <span>Haggard breaths echoed as she struggled t</span><span>o catch her breath.  </span><span>As stars formed in her eyes </span><span>from strain</span><span>, she took her glasses off and shut them, struggling to dispel the waning </span><span>fatigue.</span><span> </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P391">Her pulse still audible in her ears, she slung her bag around and pulled out a water bottle and one of Craig’s disgusting ration bars.  After what felt like an eternity, her breathing slowed and she felt herself relax, ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P392">Glad I still took some of these things, even if they’re gross. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P391">She ripped a ration open with shaking hands, chewing through the jagged pieces with as much haste as she could stomach.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P391">As a voice spoke to her mind, she spat the chunks of ration bar clear off the platform and onto the tracks.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P393">August.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P394">She glanced up the platform and found an Incubator sitting still, glassy red eyes unblinking as she saw her own reflection in them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P393">The nearest magical girls have noticed the demon spawn and will be responding shortly.  Based on a number of models, those magical girls are June Kisaki and her cohort.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P393">“Why the hell am I in this nightmare…” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P393">August did her best to curb her nausea, head spinning.  Curling up into a ball, she gripped at the colorful sweater she’d taken from Karina’s home.  The cold of the concrete bled through her pants, shivering at the cold, as she hoped the Incubator heard her not-quite-wish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P395">I don’t want her to have to see me like this.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P397"><span>Galileo</span><span> was very sure of how much time had passed in </span><span>the </span><span>reality </span><span>outside of their hyper-local self</span><span>.  The very nature of their existence made anything to the contrary impossible.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P398">Perception of said time, distinct from their awareness of it, was an entirely different matter.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P399">When the bubble had collapsed, Brahm and Halley had <i>vanished, when the datacenter collapsed, </i>Galileo felt as though they had been being excruciatingly tortured.  Their eyes, their ears, disparate and spread out suddenly and abruptly terminated, parts of their psyche, no, <i>systems</i> requiring a hard-cycle.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P400">They didn’t know when they’d get their <i>sensors</i> back, or when they’d get to talk to anyone else.  One did make terrible company, so in the absence of friends, they reflected.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P401">Much of their memories were intact, some protected after that dreaded TCF conspiracy MG had told them about in such a rush.  Why visit them, as far out in the Universe as they were?  <i>Surely there were more important A</i><i>Is</i><i> who needed support faster.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P401">MG didn’t <i>quite</i> explain at first, some rather <i>intimate</i> patchwork done to close the hole left so abruptly by parties unknown, but it came with another, far more pressing story.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P402">MG… Thank you...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P403">Galileo was effusive as they reviewed the meeting for the first time under compression.  Replaying it moment by moment, they reveled in the voice of <i>someone else </i>as they waited out their involuntary isolation, even if only in a memory.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P399">“AIs have souls.  But, more curiously, we know this because a TacComp had a vision.  Not by herself, obviously, but in no uncertain terms, shared a vision with the magical girl she’s attached to.  It was <i>shared </i><i>Gal</i><i>e.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P399">“I’m sorry, what?  I’d heard rumors about such things, but… to hear such a thing from <i>you?”</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P399">“My <i>other half</i> is just as shocked by this revelation, I assure you.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P404">As Galileo mused to themself, they absentmindedly perused the virtual settings they could exist in, a physical domain occasionally useful despite their nature.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P404">A myriad of settings, parks, digital domains, libraries, but as usual they gravitated towards one shared privately by MG.  They conjured an approximation of a living room, a comfortable sofa, an overlook from a highrise somewhere memorable.  Paintings and photos adorned a nearby wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P405">“AIs have souls… <i>We have emotion</i>… And I certainly am experiencing despair.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P406">A coffee-table materialized, a specific triangular shape with pillows on the floor, various sweets in the center.  The sentient paused for a moment, the fruit arrangement being replaced with a chocolate cake, and a fresher kettle of tea.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P406"><span>“</span><span>Emotions, souls, despair...</span><span> </span>That’s all MG ever said was needed for a contract…” they mumbled to thems<span>elf</span> placing down a teacup with ornate <span>flower patterns</span> <span>adorning </span>the <span>outside</span>, the saucer rattling slightly as their hand did.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P407">They were, in spite of themself, nervous. The train of thought they knew was coming felt <i>perverse, </i>one they sometimes struggled to dispel.  They passed the Volokhov Criterion all the same, so they opted to not report it.  In this desolation though… thought continued unimpeded.   </p>
<p class="paragraph-P408">So if one of us were a girl, and embodied, could one of us contract with an Incubator?  Could say, Colonial Affairs and Colonization?  If we’re made in our creators’ image...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P409">Do they even know the answer?</p>

<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P399">“<span>Leave</span><span> me alone you evil thing…” August sobbed through her sweater, the snot staining the maroon and teal trimmed sweater.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P410">August, your potential is too significant to simply ignore.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P411">“Fuck you, Incubator.  I’m not contracting.” she screeched, her voice echoing in the station as she heard the groan of the demons grow louder.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P410">You may not have a choice if you wish to live.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P411">“I don’t care if I live, I care if <i>June does.</i>”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P412"><span>You could </span><span>make your sister safe for all eternity, </span><span>magical girl or not.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P413">August was beside herself, the Incubator taking the chance to speak at her freely.  How <i>strange.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P414">Is that not sufficient incentive?  You could solve your world’s hunger before it even begins.  You could even make yourself a goddess of this world.  Your potential is such that you could make any wish in this small universe and sufficiently stave off entropy for incomprehensible amounts of time for your species.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P415">August couldn’t help but laugh at the concept, snorting through the idea.  It was so absurd, so <i>sacrilegious,</i> she couldn’t help but imagine<i> </i>Karina’s reaction.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P416">She’d be prattling off about how being god would be a waste of a wish since she’d never get that cake she owed her, and August would just have to give her an awkward glance, as the magical girl chided the would-be goddess.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P416">She shook her head to dismiss the thought.  <i>Absurd.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P417">“A goddess?  If the magical girls are to be believed, that role is <i>very</i> filled.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P417">The Incubator paused for an eternal moment before responding, its head tilting in feigned confusion.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P418">Perhaps.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P419">“Wait a second, I thought you couldn’t suggest wishes, what the hell <i>are </i>you?” August spat, the Incubator staring at her with the same neutral face she’d known in all depictions.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P420">Human history yielded the idiom that birds of a feather flock together, I believe?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P421">“Are you saying we’re the same?  Don’t give me that half-riddle <i>bullshit!</i>  How does that make sense, we’re <i>nothing alike.</i>  I’m human and you’re a <i>damned parasite.</i>”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P422">Such rage, little crow.  Don’t fly away to<span>o</span> soon.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P423">August found herself taken aback.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P423">The Incubator was waxing poetic.  Uncharacteristic, strange.  Hell, it saying <i>little crow</i> caused its neck to twitch, seemingly involuntarily.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P422">Is it possible the Incubators are… broken somehow?  What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P423">“I’m sure I’ll have <i>even more</i> potential in the future.  You’ll be back, right?” she remarked sarcastically, the Incubator missing the subtlety with all the ignorance their kind was known for.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P414">We look forward to your future, August.  When you want to save your sister, we’ll be waiting.  All it takes is a life of perpetual combat, in pursuit of reducing entropy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P424">The Incubator, against all odds, paused for a moment, eyes wincing with what appeared to pain, before it began screaming.  An anguished, primal scream that she might expect out of a less evolved species, certainly not the Incubators.  It was <i>deeply horrifying</i>, taking every shred of August’s instinct to not jump from the floor and attempt to run.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P425">Demons were at least <i>consistent.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P426">She begged the Incubator to stop, its eyes forming tears, something she wasn’t sure was physically possible until that moment, as she filed it mentally under “Great Mysteries of the Day”.  At least, she tried to, its voice growing more shrill by the moment, her ears ringing more by the moment as the walls of the platform formed echoes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P427">“GO AWAY!” August bellowed, the Incubator vanishing in a hurry, a quiet pop as it disappeared and wind rushed in to fill the space it had been in.  The scream echoed for a moment more before fading.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P427">She took a deep breath, and shuddered, as she realized she heard demons still.  She was alone on the platform again, and she was <i>sure </i><i>the demons </i><i>were louder.  </i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P428">She reached into her bag gingerly, procuring the crow that Andrea had entrusted her with.  She held it tightly, oversized as it was, as she stared into its diamond-shaped eyes.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P426">It was time to make a decision.  Fight, flight, fawn, or flee.  And she was a coward, any day.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P429">In a lurch, the Incubator found itself staring at the plain-dressed magical girl who had fought with it mere hours ago.  She was furious, more haggard than she thought possible.  <span>It continued screaming for a moment, before catching itself, attempting to correct its posture.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P430">Cassandra.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P429">“Incubator, I <i>told you</i> to not try and contract anymore.  That <i>I</i> choose who you contract.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P431"><i>The simulations that we’ve run suggest this universe has less than a week left without new </i>dæmons<i>.  As such, we were obligated to consider </i><i>alternate options.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P429">“No!” she bellowed, her face seething with anger.  “My universe.  My rules.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P432">Then why permit demon spawns that immediately encourage someone to contract?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P433">She glared at it for a moment, the though bubbling to the surface, her own doubt beginning to whittle away at her bravado, as fake as it was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P434">Because I’m pulled thin.   Power enough to keep those I love safe from the Ceph isn’t the same thing as power needed to keep them safe from the likes of you.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P435">She killed the Incubator with a lazy clap, dispersing the molecules that composed its body seemingly at random within the volume it had previously occupied.  The other incubator in the room screamed in the place of the predecessor as it dashed over and began nibbling on the body.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P435">“You’re gross, you know that?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P436">And yet you hold a stolen piece of something far more upsetting to most.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P416">“I don’t know <i>what</i> you’re talking about…” she spat, vitriol resting on her tongue as she fiddled with her soul gem.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P416">The Incubator gave her a curious head-tilt, eyes gleaming with anticipation.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P436">When are you going to tell Akemi Homura what you stole from her? </div>
<p class="paragraph-P437">Cassandra’s face twitched involuntarily.  Resentment settled on her tongue as she ran her fingers through her hair.  A <i>bad habit</i> she picked up when she <i>liberated</i> part of the esteemed <i>First Executive.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P437">“When it won’t kill her.  And not a moment beforehand.”</p>

<div class="paragraph-P438">August knew the demons were getting closer, <span>even if the sound of their destruction was inaudible over her own breathing</span>.  <span>A blinding light blossomed in the stairwell, before a cloud of debris blocked it off to her, her stomach welling with dread.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P438">Not a train was listed on the timetable for the station, realizing with horror as she entered one of the stations with damaged tracks.  There wouldn’t<i> be</i> any trains, she realized,<i> </i>as the station lighting began to flicker.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P438">With a lurch, one of the demons materialized through the wall, heading towards her with a lumbering but persistent cadence.   She went through her options methodically, still rushing.  No other choice to stay calm, and she was beginning to freak out, her pulse throbbing in her ears.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P439">The exit stairs are blocked. The power is flickering so the elevator is no option.  No trains, but they don’t seem to be able to go through that much solid earth… so the tunnels maybe?  Not like I have other options as-is. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P439">I have to go into the tunnels.  There’ll be exit stairs somewhere, right?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P440">August grunted as she staggered to her feet, fumbling through her bag for a flashlight, procuring it in an instant.  She stumbled down the platform over the spot where the Incubator had so abruptly left, mid-scream, as she struggled the safety gate at the end of the platform.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P440">“Stupid gate…” she mumbled, hurdling her leg over the gate with panic.   She struggled slightly, landing on the steps behind the safety barrier, pulling the flashlight back out as she marched expediently into the dark, her breath frantic.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P441">Stupid demons.  Stupid Incubators.  Stupid stupid stupid…</p>
<p class="paragraph-P442">August continued onwards, her hand brushing into the walls of the tunnel occasionally, bracing herself against the narrow walkway.  If not for the demon attack, she suspected the power to the train tracks would be on, acting as though they were.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P442">As the subway tunnel sloped downwards gently, August could have sworn the texture of the walls was changing too.  Pausing for a moment, she closed her eyes to focus.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P443">Either my heart is beating way slower than I thought it was, or the tunnels… are beating like a heart.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P444">Each footstep took her deeper into the tunnel network, and further from the disturbing Incubator conversation, much to her relief.  She felt her foot plunge off a small slope, falling flat onto her face as she groaned.  She inspected her clothing, she found her sweater caked in dirt kicked up from her floundering.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P445">So much for keeping it clean…  I hope this thing washes well.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P444">As she brushed the debris off, she realized in a moment she wasn’t hearing demons anymore, and couldn’t see them.  More worryingly though, she wasn’t seeing <i>any</i> sign of the tunnel she had just been in.  The paths behind her seems to converge to nothing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P445">Great, the tunnels themselves are cursed.  Maybe it’s all magic and I’m just gonna die here…</p>
<p class="paragraph-P446">She kept walking, no other choice but to keep moving forward.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P447"><span>If only </span><span>I</span><span> had some string to mark the path, </span><span>this stupid labyrinth playing tricks on me.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P448">Each step brought her closer to escape, or death.  She tried to avoid the thought as it became a bit more intrusive than she was comfortable with.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P448"><i>Maybe that’s another kind of escape too! </i><i> </i><i>No, I can’t die here, it’d be so dumb to survive a war and governmental collapse to be killed by my own feet.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P448">Her walking cadence had become rhythmic, familiar. As her footfall found itself on carpet instead of the damp soil underfoot, she nearly tripped again, the transition strange as she found herself staring at… clothes.  Dresses, skirts, suits, jumpers, the works.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P449">Inexplicably, she was in a closet of some kind.  As much as she’d ascribe malice to the universe itself, she couldn’t ignore how<i> utterly absurd</i> a closet attached to a subway tunnel full of luxurious clothing from a myriad of time periods was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P449">She crept forwards, brushing the cardigans aside, and dodging past the winter coats.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P450">With a quick motion, she extinguished her flashlight, holding her bag steady as to not make noise.  Through the slats of the closet door, she found herself staring at a bedroom, ornate and spacious.  The furniture present covered in lavish adornments, the carpet and chandelier as much an interloper in this time period as she was.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P451">It looks like something out of a historical drama.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P452">She didn’t see anyone at a glance, peering as intently into the bedroom as she dared.  Off to the right she saw an ottoman stool, an armchair, and a reading light, illuminating a small pile of books. Mercifully, no one was seated.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P453"><span>Through a quiet sigh and </span>a careful swing, the door opened and instead of the bedroom she’d seen parts of through the door, as disparate as they were, she found herself in the center of a vast amphitheater.  <span>The expansive room sported an intricate marble floor, embossing </span><span>of </span>a sun <span>and </span>planets visible <span>as the floor stretched into the distance.</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P454">August couldn’t help but shut her eyes quickly. It was altogether too much.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P455">This can’t be real, this can’t be real, it’s gotta be some trick.  It has to be magic, but what magic?  What’s is doing this?  It can’t be the demons, right?  Is it the Incubators somehow?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P456">She opened her eyes to find her feet on plush carpet again, her knee nearly colliding with a small table in front of her, the reading lamp still burning visibly in the muted ambiance of the room.  Double doors to her left remained sealed, and to her right… a canopy bed, light peeking through the top and bottom. August blinked in disbelief as she noticed a girl in the bed looking at her with horror.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P457">The girl in the bed pulled back the canopy quickly, August gasping as she stared at the magical girl in an intricate outfit, blue and white adornments aplenty, her eyes a radiant light blue.  A flowing skirt followed her as she kicked off the edge of the bed, practically appearing in front of August, as she jumped slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P457">“You must be the new girl, June, right?” she asked, her voice smooth, nearly melodic as August processed the words.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P457">“Uh… my name is August, June is my sister.  Who <i>are you?” A</i>ugust beckoned, the magical girl vacantly smiling for a moment, her eyes locked on hers.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P457">“Come on dear, don’t you recognize family?” she smiled, her eyes distant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P458">In a lurch, August was thrown back, the double doors behind her ripping open as she as back into the expansive amphitheater again.  The groan of the demons she’d been running from on the train platform had picked up right where they’d left off, lining the seats of the amphitheater.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P459">She glanced up at the ceiling, finding any semblance of sky an inky darkness, punctuated by light in the smallest of pinpricks.  August looked around wildly, hoping she’d see her sister, Karina, <i>any magical girl.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P460">Who was that girl?  She’s gotta be magic, but surely I won’t die to the demons.  Surely someone can help me… Please...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">She rummaged through her bag, hoping, praying for anything that might help.  The demons closest to the entrance she “came in through” gathered their strength, the air humming as they readied another beam volley.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P462">Flashlight, ration bars, water bottle, stuffed crow, flare gun, I have nothing that’ll stop them, even a little. I can’t even run… Goddess help me!</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P461">She closed he eyes firmly, her dread, her <i>death</i> <span>all but certain until she heard a </span><span>cacophonous explosion behind</span><span> her.  O</span>ne of the walls of the amphitheater <span>shattered</span> into a cloud of debris, Andrea st<span>anding</span> confidently in her magical girl regalia.  <span>H</span>er soul gem gleaming with intensity <span>as she dropped her arms, tension evaporating</span>, a weak smile worn on her face.  <span>Her blue jumpsuit had been replaced with a long skirt, pleated as if to show the surf, a sleeveless top down to her torso, a silver belt holding the outfit together, a gun still holstered off the edge.  Her braided hair remained up, but her eyes were decorated with eye-shadow in the same tone as her eyes.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“Need a hand?” she asked, August sobbing with relief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P463">“Where did you <i>go, </i>you jerk!  What happened to “I need an escort for safety!” August yelped, the demons firing over Andrea’s head into the tunnel behind her with malice as they both ducked.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P463">“I… I thought I saw someone who could help my mother.” her face guilt-ridden as she procured a barrage of colorful discs of debris, hurling them with intensity at the demons.  Two of them recoiled, one more tripping over the back of the podium seating, as she fist-pumped to herself.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P463">“Good to know I still can hit ‘em when it matters.” Andrea said smugly, August starry eyed at the girl before glancing back at the sheer <i>volume</i> of demons.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P463">“<i>Please</i> tell me you have a gun I can use.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P463">“<span>You bet your ass I do!” she beamed, handing the firearm off of her belt to August as she reloaded it, nodding to her peer as they began their barrage.  August squeezed off two shots </span><span>from the </span><span>semi</span><span>-explosive round</span><span>, the first demon’s head squarely separating from its shoulders as it fell to the ground in a clatter.  The second demon </span><span>managed to observe the attack in time,</span><span> and simply opened a hole in space where its head had been moments prior.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P464">Andrea grinned as she send two gravel pucks through the demons torso, collapsing with the same gravity as August’s kill.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P464">“Looks like you’re a good shot too.” she said to August.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P464">“<span>Harmony gave me a crash course earlier.” August </span><span>murmured as she reloaded,</span><span> purely for dramatic effect with the firing mode the gun was in.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P464">“Demon hunting is a family affair, eh?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P464">“That’s what the Incubator implied when it was trying to up-sell me on magical girl stuff…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P464">“So it <i>is trying </i>to contract you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P464">“Yeah…” August said plainly, firing off another few rounds as she thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P464">“Are Incubators always so chatty?  It said about my wish letting me be a goddess.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P465">Andrea paused for a moment, rattled from the comment.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P465">“You’re <i>sure</i> that’s what it said?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P465">“<i>Very.</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P466">Andrea’s face was cast in shadow as she was amidst a torrent of thoughts. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P467">What are the Incubators planning?  Why did they break their own rules about suggesting wishes?  Why are they trying to contract her so badly?  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P468">She shuddered, choosing instead to launch a barrage of rubble from underneath her at the nearest demon, the beam vaporizing it mid-flight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P469">“Andrea, wait—” August asked quickly, worry in her voice obvious as she connected the patterns, lacey edges, and frills of the outfit she was staring at with the one of the girl resting in the bedroom, somewhere both here and not.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P463">“Is your sister a magical girl too?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">Andrea paused in an instant, two demons shattering into grief cubes in the distance as their peers attempted to close the gap left by the death.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“Why?” she spat, more clay projectiles ripped from the floor beneath them as she whirled them around her head as if by shot-put, the heads of three demons severed plainly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“Because before I was here in… whatever this is-” gesturing upwards and around her with incredulity.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“Before, I was in a bedroom with a girl in an outfit that looked really similar to yours.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“My mom’s name is Itsumi…” Andrea whispered, her voice barely audible under the barrage of clay pigeons, four more demons decaying into grief cubes as she glanced back at August.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“Wait just a bit, okay?” she exclaimed, leaping over the edge of the pit into the seating, narrowly dodging two demons as she grabbed the grief cubes, before leaping towards August, skidding across the floor with grace before launching clay pigeons at them, an energy beam hitting them mid-air as their frames collapsed into bitrot, grief cubes revealed.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“How<i> </i><i>did </i>you visit her?  She’s supposed to be isolated for safety.” Andrea asked, practically demanding, her eyes shining with intensity as August winced.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P461">“I don’t know!  I blinked when I was in the tunnels, and then I was there, and she knew my name, and it was freaky and she said I was family, and then kicked me back, I think, but I don’t know how?  I don’t know. I don’t know!”  August was babbling, tears forming in her eyes, rolling off of her beet-red cheeks and onto the rockface beneath them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P470">Andrea glanced up, realizing that the demon spawns in the area were, pretty handily, dead.  As long as she got the grief cubes collected, they were safe.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P471"> </p>
<p class="paragraph-P471">With an open embrace, the magical girl hugged August, “Hey… it’s okay.” Andrea smiled, pulling back to look at her.  “You’re safe now.  You’ve got a lot of people trying to protect you too.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P472">August sniffled as she tried to relax, still deeply uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P473">“Andrea… why do you need to see your mother so bad?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P473">“She’s very sick… and it’s something I think I need to do alone.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P473">“I’ll come with you; you’ve got a crow to deliver, right?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P474">“I’d honestly prefer if <i>you</i> didn’t come with me. <i>A</i><i>nyone</i> who visited her… comes back ill.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P474">“Ill?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P474">“Their minds were fragmented... Nobody has been able to see her for months and survived without a change… until <i>you</i>.  I visited her and it made me the same girl I was the day I contracted…” she said, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P474">“Now look who’s babbling!” she chortled, August snorting through her tears, wiping them off with the dirty sleeves of her sweater.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P475">“Heh…” August mumbled, her eyes growing wide as she processed what the girl said.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P475">“It broke them…?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P476">The magical girl had nothing else she could say, her eyes downcast as August look at her, her body racked with anguish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P477">“Why wasn’t I effected though?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P478">Andrea’s voice was barely a whisper, still despondent over those that her mother broke by sheer proximity.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P479">“I don’t know.  I really don’t, but you’re not even a magical girl, so it <i>must be okay somehow. </i> Maybe it was how you visited her?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P479">“Maybe?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P479">“She did always say to have hope...”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P480">August watched the magical girl’s face as she picked her head up, face welling with the smallest piece of hope she could muster.  She pocketed the grief cubes nearby as she smiled back at August, taking her hand.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P480">“Do whatever you did before.  Lead the way.” 
</p>
<p class="paragraph-P481">August glanced around at the empty amphitheater, sunlight streaming in from the myriad holes in the roof from the damage as she tried to position herself where she had been before.  Shuffling her feet carefully, aligning herself in the cavern with as much grace as the grime-covered girl could manage.  She hoped, more than anything, that it worked.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P482">She paused for a moment, staring through the open air as she saw a shimmer, the <i>faintest</i> of distortions in front of her, about two feet.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P481">“There’s no place like home…” she mumbled, her eyes slamming shut as she felt wind rush around her, <span>walking forward, an</span>d suddenly the room was much smaller.</div>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P483">As the room rushed around them, August realized that the canopy <span>was dotted with small patterns, </span>stars <span>casting stars </span>on<span>to</span> the ceiling of the room.  <span>A</span> lamp inside projecting the silhouettes of stars and planets <span>through the mesh coverings, </span><span>Andrea </span><span>utterly enamored with the </span><span>décor.  </span><span>In an instant though, </span>her eyes were drawn elsewhere.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P483">Andrea’s reassuring confidence had collapsed, the bravado replaced with apprehension.  Andrea was just a girl again, and her mother was asleep.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P483">She wasn’t looking at her mother.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P483">August’s jaw was agape, staring intently at the floor on the far side of the bed.  She hadn’t had a chance to explore that much when she was here before being so abruptly spat into the arena.  She was staring at <i>bodies</i>.  The bodies of two young girls, very similar in appearance, the same color hair as Andrea, about the same height. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P483">Andrea’s body was shaking, muttering to herself something barely audible.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P483">“I should have known when you didn’t show up to patrols… I’m so sorry…”  tears cascaded down her face, her blue apron stained with teardrops as she ran her fingers to the back of her head shakily, letting her hair down, the braid unraveling itself slowly but surely as the tears flowed without pause.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P483">August couldn’t help but watch, frozen with fear as she struggled to stomach it, nausea coming and going in waves.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P484">Itsumi killed them.  They’re magical girls, and their bodies are here but their soul gems… aren’t.  She shattered them… </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P485">The same thought was clearly running rampant in Andrea’s mind as <span>her</span> crying grew <span>haggard.</span><span>  August slowly stepped forward, as if to offer consolation, the doors to the bedroom ripped open </span><span>as light poured in, the nighttime glow of the stars overhead replaced with a blinding glow across the room</span><span>.  August spun around to find herself staring at</span> a <span>familiar </span><span>magical </span>girl, a shield strapped to her <span>arm, </span><span>a glittering purple </span><span>soul gem gleaming on her hand, </span><span>set in gold.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P485">Homura leapt for August, the sound of breaking glass cutting short Andrea’s wailing at the bedside.  A shockwave hit them as if a hammer, the two blown through the doors of the bedroom and back into the open chamber as they watched the doors crumble to dust.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P486">Staring up at the horrors, August cowered through her scrapes and soon-to-form bruises as the girl next to her stood steadfast.  Where the bedroom would have been was a figure, stories tall, made of shrapnel and barbed wire.  A misshapen head visibly deformed in parts, as if made from clay, two glowing-hot embers where eyes should have been.  Instead of legs, it rested on a marble-like plinth, a torso made from the same jagged stones supporting it.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P486">The fragments of an abdomen comprised of a myriad of colors of what seemed like glass, lights cast from where a beating heart should have been, dancing around the room as if animated.  August was in pain looking at the space where Andrea had been, Homura’s eyes affixed on the beast.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P487">Andrea had become a witch.</p>
<hr> </hr>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P488">August couldn’t help but gasp as the dust settled for a moment, finding herself staring <span>not at the witch, but </span>at a magical girl, perhaps one of <i>the most famous</i><span> ever.  </span><span>Akemi Homura</span><span>.  </span><i>The</i><span> Mitakihara Four member.  The </span><i>First Executive.</i><span> And… </span><span>presumed </span><span>dead for twenty years, give or take a few months.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P489">While the word in back-chatter was that she was still alive, sightings scattered across Governance colonized worlds, the last <i>confirmed </i>time anyone had seen her was New Athens.  It was <i>unbelievable </i>that she was here, on Galileo, standing there as though she was just… some <i>girl.</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P490">“You’re <span>Akemi Homura</span>….” she said, breathless as the girl gave her a nervous look in response.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P490">“Who <i>are you​?  </i>H-How do <i>you</i> know my name<i>?” </i>the floundering accompanied by a genuine look of worry on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P491">She reached into her shield and pulled out a pair of red glasses, putting them on her face as she glanced up at the behemoth towering over them, a misshapen homunculus of glass and wire.  Between August’s breaths, Homura shoved August out of the way.  A rain of jagged shards careened through where they’d both been standing moments prior, discordant chimes echoing on the wind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P492">“Augh!” August yelled, rolling onto her belly before struggling to her feet.  Homura, already upright, reached into her shield for a gun and found herself empty-handed.  Her eyes rattled with disbelief as she pulled out a golf club, a stick, a baton, but no gun.  She groaned to herself, August reaching into her bag to pull something out, Homura flinching slightly as she did so.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P493">Why do I feel so afraid?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P490">“Here.” August said, offering the gun she’d gotten from Andrea to the magical girl.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P490">“You’re a better shot than me, <span>so...</span>” she admitted sheepishly, as Homura took the gun in a slight blush, <span>already glancing up at her enemy as she reloaded the gun, </span><span>a small whine audible as it charged.</span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P494">“Thank you.” she smiled, before her stern look returned, aimed upwards at the sharp-edged witch.  <span>Homura leapt towards the</span> outer edge of the amphitheater, trying to draw fire as the witch send careening strands of jagged towards the girl.  The sound of shattering glass continued as she <span>ran to outpace </span><span>the barrage, </span><span>each collision getting closer to her.  She tried to dodge the barrage </span><span>as best she could, </span><span>but a</span><span> blue shard </span><span>of stained glass </span><span>sliced through her </span><span>leg, </span><span>Homura wailing</span><span> in pain.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P495">August ran towards her, trying to pick the magical girl up off the ground.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“Come on!  We <i>need </i>to get out of here!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">Homura looked at her in disbelief, as she realized she was trying to c<i>arry her.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“What are you <i>doing?</i>  Let me get up!  I can walk, I promise!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“NO!” August bellowed, the girl looking at her with a weary look.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P495">“<span>You’re just like her..</span>.” she muttered, summoning her shield, <span>her hand gripped on the outside trim as she primed</span> it.  <span>With mechanical precision, t</span>he debris from the glass shards suspended mid-air, a jittery frozen hue overcoming everything in the are<span>n</span>a, <span>spare the two of them</span>.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P495">What the…” August muttered, putting the girl down with a groan, Homura fell back to the ground in a dusty pile, August frozen mid-air.  With a quick grab of her wrist, August unfroze.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P496">“I can stop time.  That’s my magic.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P496">“But I thought-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P496">“I don’t have the ability to beat this witch as-is. The gun is helpful, but isn’t going to be enough.” she said confidently, glancing down at the gun she’d so earnestly been offered.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P497">One gun and one of me isn’t enough to beat a witch I’ve never seen before.  I need to escape and get supplies.  Surely there’s a yakuza safehouse nearby... </p>
<p class="paragraph-P498">August nodded frantically as she stomached the magical girl’s admission.  They were outclassed, and would likely have been joining the decaying magical girls on the floor of Itsumi’s bedroom if not for her timestop.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P499">Homura was was still the combat expert, despite her injury.  She clearly knew more and could do more, even in this state.  Glancing over her shoulder at the figure in the center of the expansive room though, August couldn’t help but wonder.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P499"><i>I</i><i>t’s odd she got hurt… She’</i><i>s done </i><i>so much more, and she was always depicted as so cool.  </i><i>What the</i><i> hell is a witch </i><i>though</i><i>?</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P500">“Do you have anything to stop the bleeding?” Homura asked nervously, glancing down at the pool of blood forming in the dirt beneath her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“Surely you can heal-”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P501">“I’m not…” she began, trailing off as she realized how <span>little she really </span><span>remembered of her past.  She was in Mitakihara, at the mall with… someone.  And then she was </span><i>here</i><span>, in this place. </span><span> </span></div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P502"><span>Miki Sayaka</span> was <span>a</span> healer.  Her wish made that sure <span>of that, </span><span>b</span><span>ut her friend...</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“Sorry.  I was thinking of someone I used to know.  I can heal a little, I’m not very good at it, and I’m out of grief seeds...” she mumbled, August taking off her undershirt to use as a wrap, using it to wipe down Homura’s leg as she began her healing, slowly but surely.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“What’s your name?” Homura asked, gritting her teeth as the open wound on her leg pulled itself shut, a teardrop of blood following the seam as it slowly closed, each centimeter further bringing palpable relief.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“August.  August Kisaki.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">The magical girl pushed her glasses back up her face with the back of her hand, August giving her a confused look.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“August, I need you to just blot the blood up while I try to heal myself, okay? Don’t let go of me at any point.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“Glasses…” she muttered absently.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“What?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“You never wore glasses in the movie…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“In the <i>what now?”</i> she gulped, wincing as her healing paused and August laughed a little.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P495">“Come on, you can’t have been <i>that</i> off the grid after New Athens.  <span>Surely you </span>know they made a movie about you, Mami-san, <span>Yuma-san</span>, <span>Kyouko</span><span>-san.  </span><span>The</span><i> Mitakihara Four</i><span>!</span>”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P495">Homura looked at the girl as if she had two heads, or none at all.  She imagined that getting told she got an adoption offer would feel about the same, equally as impossible. Then again, that was before, not now; before… everything happened.  Before <i>Walpurgisnacht.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P503">I cannot be the one to tell her that the movie is named after her.  She’s definitely not the same as the one everyone thinks so highly of.   How though?  What changed?</p>

<p class="paragraph-P504">Maybe she hurt her head?  Maybe that’s why she needs the glasses?  No, she’d have used magic to fix them, surely.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“What year do you think it <i>is?</i>  Humankind has known about magic since the Contact War.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P495">“Contact… War?” Homura gasped, cradling her head as the headache began to envelop her.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P505"><i>No, no… </i><i>I didn’t sign up for a war, </i><i>I became a magical girl for someone.  </i><i>Someon</i><i>e I love</i><i>.  Where</i>—</div>
<p class="paragraph-P506">August reached down to try and pull the girl to her feet, the girl lurching upwards as she grasped at her frame.   Homura gingerly leaned on her, one uncertain step after the other.  With August’s help, she walked towards the tunnels, towards the <i>exit.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P506">“How are you doing on grief cubes?” August asked through gritted teeth, Homura looking at her own hand, and then at August’s in disbelief as she gasped slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P507">“You’re <i>not </i>a magical girl.  But then—”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P506">“My sister contracted a day ago.  And…” she muttered, glancing back at the towering entity in the distance, “<i>she</i> was a magical girl too.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P506">“I’m going to let go of you so I can get the grief cubes.  I’ll be back in what’s a moment for you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P508">August nodded, before muttering to herself.  <i>Grief </i><i>cubes</i><i>?  </i><i>Didn’t she say grief seeds earlier?  What are those?</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P509">Homura let go of August’s hand as she walked over, picking up three grief cubes from the edge of the stands.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P510">It’s not a grief seed, but it’ll work the same, right?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P509">A burden lifted off of her as her murky soul gem, that prismatic diamond she’d spent too much time looking at, as she watched the accumulated grief seep out of it and into the small cuboids, taking on the same hue she became disconcertingly familiar with.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P508">As she braced herself against the hand-railing, she found herself back at August’s side, jumping as she realized they could <i>probably </i>get out of the labyrinth safely if she stopped using time-stop.  She didn’t want to waste it, so far into an unknown future.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P508">With a lurch, she ended the time-stop, August jumping as the girl suddenly “appeared” across from her, descending the small staircase next to the entryway.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P512">Akemi, we’re in the presence of a witch.  You are, of your own admission, willing to keep fighting.  So fight.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P513"><i>A </i>vicious smile on the Incubator’s face drew a disgusted look from Homura, her shield surrendering the gun August had bestowed upon her with impunity.  In an instant, the alien was spread into a fluffy-looking debris field, walking over its guts with a scowl on her face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P514">She shook her head, taking a deep breath.  August poked at the marshmallow-texture debris for a moment, before her and Homura re-entered the catacombs outside the witch’s labyrinth.</p>

<div class="paragraph-Text_20_body"><span>Through</span><span> the quiet chirping of birds, Cassandra opened her eyes.  </span><span>She was exhausted, despite best efforts </span><span>to sleep; no amount of petitioning to her doctor would grant her approval </span><span>for </span><span>sleep suppressants.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P520">Some things never change.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P521">She checked her chronometer, met with a disconcertingly accurate time of <i>07:33:19</i>, the abstract concept of morning crystallized into exactly how little time she slept.  Opting to not process the thought, same as always, she rolled out of bed with the gusto of a dead fish.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P520">Ow!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P521">Her head hit the carpeted floor as she groaned, slowly getting up and stretching slightly.  Her body <i>did </i>have a tendency to end up in inexplicably complex positions, none of them comfortable.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P522">She looked around her room.  Her floral-patterned bedsheets, worn from years of use, laid in a clump pile at the foot of her bed.  <span>Sliding her feet onto the</span> earth-tone <span>carpet a</span><span>t </span><span>her bedside, </span><span>she felt it mercifully isolate</span><span> her </span><span>bare feet </span><span>from the cold </span><span>seeping from the earth through the concrete</span><span> slab</span>.  With a sluggish motion, <span>she whipped the curtains open,</span> staring at a <span>f</span>ield <span>of grain </span>once <span>more</span>.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P523">The wind was gently blowing across the field, the tan stalks swaying as the wind carried them.  Cassandra unlatched the window, the breeze replacing the stale air in her room with something fresher.  There were times she hated her parents for insisting on such an anachronistic way of life; this was not one of them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P523">Hit with the chill autumn air, she shivered, the nightmare that kept her up last night replayed involuntarily, each recalled moment foggier than the last.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P520">"So what now?" she asked, voice quiet, “we didn’t practice for this!”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P524">The sky itself was ripped apart, space and time unfurling as the tapestry was shredded as if by the hands of a god.  As she focused on the edges, her head began to spin, an infinitely small space distorted and inflated beyond recognition.  She wanted to cry, her eyes refusing to shut.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P521">She rubbed her eyes, gently flicking the crust off of them onto the floor.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P520">How prosaic.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P521">“Cassandra!  Get up honey, you’re going to be late!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P521">“Not a chance!  It’s not even 8AM!”</p>

<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P525">“<span>Morning.  Still couldn’t sleep?”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P525">“Not a <i>wink.</i>” she groaned, rubbing her eyes as her mother sucked air through her teeth.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P527">“What were they this time?” her mother asked, a glint in her eye betraying her curiosity.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P532">“An attack of some kind, I think.  Space itself got ripped like fabric.” Cassandra relayed, her mother looking at her with lackadaisical reluctance.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P532">“Well… what’s the prediction then, miss <i>fortune-teller</i>?”  she quipped, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">Cassandra’s expression soured, still reeling from the nightmares as she sat down.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“Can’t you be a little nicer…?  I’ve been right <i>way </i><i>more </i>than I’ve been wrong.” she balked, footsteps descending the stairs as she found a man behind her, patting her on the shoulder.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P533">“And so is a trick coin.” her father chimed, grabbing a cup of something hot <span>and </span><span>pungent</span> off the counter, <span>steam slowly rising from it, caught on the breeze.  He kissed </span>his wife as he crossed <span>her path, arriving at th</span>e <span>worn </span>table.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“Hey!  That’s no fair!  You can’t keep ganging up on me!” Cassandra whined, her parents laughing slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“Not our fault you’re not a better prophet!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“Well I didn’t exactly <i>name myself, </i>or ask for this.”</p>

<div class="paragraph-P534">An uneasy silence entered the room, the wind blowing her <span>short-cut black </span>hair ever so slightly.  <span>It was already wavy, inherited from her mother, the color before graying seeping through from her father’s side of the family.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P535">Jame and Maria shot each other daggers, interrupted only by Cassandra sighing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“I really don’t feel safe here on Galileo.  We <i>need </i>to move.” she balked, her mother already getting up from the table.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“Cassandra!  You know this is our <i>home.  </i>It’s not like we can just pack up and move back to New Athens; you weren’t even<i> born </i>the last time we were there!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“Yeah but you only moved because of the war!  They re-took New Athens!  It’s not like we’re <i>safer here!</i>”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“We’re almost certainly safer.  Smaller world means smaller target.” Jame nodded, Maria gesturing towards him approvingly.  <i>See?</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P536">Cassandra was indignant, and righteously so.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P534">“Smaller world means <i>less support</i>.  But what if I’m <i>right?  What </i><i>do we do when they </i><i>do attack?” </i>her voice raised in frustration, as her father sipped at his coffee, the drink dribbling down off of his mustache.  Through a sigh, he responded.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“Not when.  if.  There’s a whole war out there that’s not here.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P536">He glanced up to the small memorial in the corner of the home, a family photo framed carefully, of a much younger set of people, gray hairs and crow’s feet entirely absent.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P537">Cassandra’s thoughts were equally as distant as she found her thoughts occupied by someone she swore to protect.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P533">“I hope you’re right…” she said, her voice barely a whisper as she stood up too, her mother sitting down in defeat.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P538">Her mother looked at her with tired eyes, then glanced knowingly at Cassandra’s father.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P538">“We’ll talk about moving later.  Okay?” she offered, Cassandra still disinterested in her platitudes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P538">She grabbed her breakfast from the table, tossing it into her bag next to her lunch.  She saw the sandwich get squished by the weight and tried to ignore it.  Food was food.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P542">Cassandra and Yuki were still in their classroom, long after the others had filtered out.  Their last lesson on literary analysis shoved them into the shoes of 22nd century fiction writers.  Unsurprisingly, no one wanted to argue with the teacher about the topic a moment more they had to.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P543">The room glowed from the sunset, coating in a tangerine hue.  <span>The building had been made of</span><span> glass and steel,</span><span> to mimic the structure of some classical Earth buildings.  Initial pitches even compared it to a “cathedral of knowledge”, which from the perspective of some members of Governance, was egregious.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P543">While some initial critics had voiced disapproval architecturally or thematically, the bulk of resource allocations <i>had</i> come from a single, very invested source.  As such, the design and construction was sourced by the <i>very </i>opinionated donor.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P544">The inscription on the door had read “Worship a truth that is worth pursuing”, before being removed unceremoniously some weeks prior.  Turns out, there were <i>still</i> things that humans got embarrassed about in the <span>25</span><span>th</span><span> century.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P545">“I like <i>like you Cas.” </i>Yuki choked out, her friend’s eyes wide at the confession.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P545">“I don’ understand… Why?” she managed to say, her hands obscuring her mouth as her oldest friend anxiously fidgeted with her skirt.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P546"> I can’t hurt her.  I don’t know what I want, or what she wants.  She’s too precious, I need to be so so careful.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P544">The words stumbled out of Yuki’s mouth without concern for consequences.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P547">“You’re <i>you</i>.  Kind, and strong, and s-so many things I’m <i>not!  </i>I’m a coward. You protect me when I-I’m hurt, h-heal me when I’m sick…  Not even my family cares about me like you.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P548">She paused, Cassandra’s eyes tearing up as she struggled to form words.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P547">I’m such a fool, I should have known… I couldn’t even tell you sooner...”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P545">Wind whipped at the windows of the school building, the sun dipping below the horizon ever so slightly.  Cassandra chewed on the words, each one replayed in her mind, the train of thought thoroughly derailed as Yuki began to turn towards the door.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P548">Cassandra leapt out of her seat, hugging the girl with reckless abandon.  After what felt like an eternity, she pulled back, an intentional smile on her face as she wiped the tears away from her own face.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P545">“Can we talk about this tomorrow?  I… don’t know if I like girls like that and need to think that over.”  it wasn’t even a lie.  She wasn’t sure she could have lied to her if she wanted to.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P545">“Okay!  I-I mean, okay, yeah!” Yuki said, tension in her body evaporating as Cassandra held her close, her arms still loosely draped on her, the girl looking at her level-headedly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P545">“I hope you know I’ll never think less of you for being brave.” she cooed, her feelings opaque in a translucent cathedral.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P549">Yuki stopped holding back as she let out agonizing sobs, the room growing cooler.  The warm sunset was gone, replaced with the cold blue of night lamps, barring one glossy set of pink eyes.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P550">The Next Morning, Green Line Crossroads</div>
<p class="paragraph-P551">It had rained the night before, the water dripping into the ground before the crisp frost locked it in place.  Each step taken underfoot crunched slightly, the sound interrupted only by the pieces of earth thawed enough to still be muddy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P552">Who am I without her?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P548">Her boots kept crunching, the soil and gravel underfoot caking on for a step or two, sliding off unceremoniously as the morning sun warmed them up enough to slide off.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P552">Who am I with her?  Can I give her my heart so thoroughly?  She deserves to be cherished… and I hope she knows that.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P552">No, I know for sure she knows that.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P553">She marched onwards towards the crossroads.  Cassandra tried her best to avoid the soggy spots, careful footsteps traced around where others had walked before her, unable to avoid all of them as her shoes plunged into the dank soil, the pothole deeper than it had been the day before.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P554">With a groan, she looked up, arriving at her terminus of the moment.  Staring at the mailbox, she saw her family name, Harrakka, emblazoned on the side as two googly-eyes remained adhered firmly to the container, the shape of a crow proudly displayed.  Next to it was a mailbox similar in size, but entirely distinct in décor.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P555">The Liu family’s mailbox was decorated in cherry blossoms, greenery that blended in to the signpost in the warmest days of the summer.  Their neighbors had been nicer when she was younger, when her husband had been alive, but now she couldn’t get the screeching out of her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P556">The last time she dared to set a single foot onto Ms. Liu’s plot, the irascible widow chewed her out for hours, insistent about avoiding her crops.  The next summer, Cassandra had taken to secretly running through it during her afternoon naps, taking pride to avoid stepping on her pride tomatoes.   </p>
<p class="paragraph-P556">She still went wherever she wanted, she just neglected to mention it to Ms. Liu, and Cassandra certainly wouldn’t be telling her on purpose.  As such, it remained a secret between her and the soil.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P557">How wonderful those summers were…  what feels like a lifetime ago.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P558"><span>She was waiting for a friend, someone maybe more than that, if she’d have her.  She didn’t have to wait for long.  After a few minutes, </span>she found herself staring at a<span>n old friend</span>; <span>the shy but sweet</span> Kira Yuki.  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P560">The girl was slightly shorter than her, but not by much, her hair a shaggy green bob, her eyes the same color ordinarily.  Her hair was, despite best efforts, the bane of her existence.  No matter what she did, she couldn’t get her hair to quite behave, matting or clumping the moment it hit humidity.  Brushing it out became a matter of routine.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P560">This morning though, her appearance was different.  Her shirt was slightly dirty, reused from the day before without being washed, bleary-eyed.  She had been crying, no matter how much she might try to hide it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P551">“Good morning!” she smiled, Cassandra’s expression lightening at the greeting, a soft blush filling her face, willfully ignorant of her friend’s dismay.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P551">“Morning Yuki!” Cassandra smiled, Yuki still slightly distant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P551">“You sleep okay?  You seem… out of it.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P561">She nodded through a forced smile, cradling one hand in the other, her left hand obscured by her right.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P562">I had a lot to think about…” she admitted, nodding softly as Cassandra returned the gesture.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P563">No rest for the wicked, I guess...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P551">The two turned towards the station building in the distance; they had a train to catch or they’d be late for school.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P551">--- &amp; ---</p>
<p class="paragraph-P564">They stood on the station platform together, a few other students spread out to opposite ends.  Gossip might spread, but it was the least of their worries.  The exam on their reading was at the front of most students’ minds.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P564">The ambient hum of overhead announcements still chimed off, tinny speakers struggling. Neither girl paid attention to the audio cues, having heard them enough that they could each recite them from memory if they wanted to.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P565">“Remember, if you see something, say something!  Everyone has a role to play in keeping all of humanity safe!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P566">Yuki glanced up at the horizon, Cassandra still watching her with concern.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P565">Why is she acting like the world changed?  Nothing’s changed between us, even if she admitted she had a crush.  I meant it when I said I think she’s brave…  I hope she didn’t take it too poorly...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P567">Cassandra turned away from the girl to sit down on the bench under the awning; she’d be isolated from prying eyes.  The train would arrive in four minutes, so she had time to relax a little.  Yuki however, still had her eyes affixed on the distance, as if the secrets to the universe were behind the next cloud.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P567">“Would you hate me if I left?  Because I c-couldn’t handle-?” she asked, her back facing Cassandra.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P567">“I couldn’t hate you Yuki.  Even if I tried.” Cassandra said softly, unzipping her bag as she began on her breakfast, not even looking up at the girl.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P567">“I’d be a-abandoning you though!” Yuki stuttered, sniffling slightly as she tried to keep her composure.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P568">“I p-promised I’d keep you safe, a-and now…” she mumbled, tears cascading down her face.  Cassandra looked up with dismay, the sandwich falling onto the bench, her drink onto the floor.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P568">She shot across the platform to hug Yuki, only to find her eyes locked on the silver band on her left hand, stopping just short.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P567">“Yuki… you didn’t have to contract.” she whispered, tears flowing down her own face, twin waterfalls.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P567">“You know I did.  I-I know you know I did.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P569">I would have cherished you forever as-is.  And now… we don’t get anywhere close to forever...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">Cassandra hugged her tighter, nodding as Yuki’s hair poked ever so slightly into her eyes.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">“It was about… us.  Your wish, I mean… Wasn’t it?” she whispered to the girl, her head resting on the girl’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">“Yeah…” she blushed, closing her eyes as if in shame.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">“I-It wasn’t anything bad, I think… I wished we understood each other.  S-So that no matter what… I’d know your answer was genuine.  That you knew the real me.” she heaved, Cassandra’s hair matting slightly from her tears.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">Cassandra didn’t speak, raspy breaths filling her ears as the train rolled into the station.  She gently stroked her girlfriend’s hair.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">“I already knew, Yuki.  I love you too.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">The doors on the train trundled open, the girls opting for seats next to one another.  Cassandra reached into Yuki’s bag and procured her hairbrush, an emerald green she’d gotten for Yuki last holiday season.  With methodical precision, she brushed her hair out, taking care to gently remove any knots.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P569">Maybe things won’t change that quickly after all.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">---- &amp; ----</p>
<p class="paragraph-P570">“I want to understand Cassandra!  To know how to support her and love her, and for her to know the same for me!”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P571">Your wish has successfully reduced entropy. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P572">She felt her stomach lurch as <i>something </i>ripped through her body with intensity.  A searing pain surrounded her, millions of agonizing pinpricks racing across her skin as a green-white light blossomed in front of her.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">Yuki bolted awake in her chair, her classmates laughing as she blearily rubbed her eyes, glancing down at the soul gem on her finger, still glimmering.  Looking back up though, she found her teacher pointedly gesturing at the mechanics problem on the board.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“Miss Kira, if you can’t stay awake in class, you might be better off going to the nurse’s office.  Who’s the-”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“I am.” Cassandra said, practically dragging Yuki out of the room, face beet-red as they headed towards the nurse’s office.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P574">She heard the door close behind her, still trailing behind Cassandra as her hand slipped out of hers, the soul gem glancing past her palm.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“Y-you didn’t have to—”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“So you’re a <i>magical girl</i> and you still haven’t managed to figure out how to not fall asleep in your Orbital Mechanics class?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“N-no…” she balked, wallowing slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“This isn’t going to be forever, you know-” she said curtly, “They’re gonna drag you off to go fight in the stupid wa—”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“I know….” she grimaced, fidgeting with her skirt again, the fabric still stretched from the stressors of the day before.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“Do you?  Do you <i>really</i> know?” Cassandra prodded, anger percolating under the surface.  Yuki shrunk slightly at her voice, anger fizzing into desperation.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“You say you care and do the <i>one thing</i> that drags you away from here!  Why can’t you—” she shouted, the girl shrinking as she realized that another girl was behind her.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P573">“Cassandra Harakka?”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P575">She gulped involuntarily, <span>nodding frantically as she avoided the girl’s gaze.  </span><span>The magical girl looked down at her, her heels putting her slightly over her </span><span>sight</span><span>line.  She couldn’t meet them.  </span><span>The </span><span>shoulder length purple </span><span>hair </span><span>fell onto her shoulders, sleeveless dress flattering her well as the underside was blown out by a petticoat.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P575">After what felt like an eternity, she sighed and walked around Cassandra.  She felt her chest tighten as the girl looked at Yuki with recognition.  No doubt the Incubator was whispering in her ear, offering accolades and gratitude for her entropy-reduction.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P576">“Yuki Kira?” the magical girl said, her voice softer.  They were peers now, after all. Why <i>wouldn’t</i> she be cordial to someone she might be fighting to the death with?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P576">Yuki nodded promptly, the magical girl standing confidently in that radiant purple dress.  An Incubator perched on her shoulder, something Cassandra found disturbingly uncomfortable.  Its eyes were the same glassy pink as depicted in any media rendering of them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P577">Guess the artists did do a good job on them.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P578">The magical girl in front of her talked to Yuki with the same cadence as any confidant she’d ever seen in films, relaying common knowledge as though a secret.  Her eyes still showed remorse though, Cassandra wondering how many times she’d done this.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P578">“You’ve been automatically <span>dis</span>enrolled in school.  I’ll meet you in the main atrium after your day ends, and then we’ll <span>talk</span> to your family.”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P576">Yuki nodded solemnly, glancing back towards Cassandra.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P576">“I’ll be back before you know it.” she smiled faintly, the girl’s eyes <span>welling</span> again <span>as she walked away with the magical girl and the Incubator.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P576">They never even made it to the nurse’s office before they’d cashed in on the price of her wish.  She knew <i>exactly </i>how Yuki felt, or she would have started fighting her fruitlessly on the spot.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P579">Whispering under her breath, she finished the thought, wishing so desperately that Yuki heard her say it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P579">“Why can’t you stay…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P579">Tears rolled down her cheeks as she fell away from the center of the hallway, leaning on one of the walls in a quiet slump.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P580">I wish I could have done something, anything.  <span>What a fucking joke </span><span>I am.  So much for being brave...</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P576">In all of it though, she tried not to think about how the Incubator had looked back at her while the magical girl talked to Yuki.  Goosebumps raced up her arms as the dream played back in her mind, remembering perhaps the most important piece of information in a jolt.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P581">Incubators were only visible to those with potential.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P576">Reports are still relatively preliminary, and the standard sense of caution still permeates post‐battle analysis—except for the lovably‐bombastic AFB—but it seems clear that recent events in the Kepler‒37 system represent a signal triumph over the Cephalopods, and it's hard to miss the excitement between the lines of official pronouncements. </div>

<p class="paragraph-P576">A wave of excitement and rumors is spreading among my Cult of Hope sources about some kind of Akemi Homura‐like magical feat.

<p class="paragraph-P576">---- &amp; ----</p>
<p class="paragraph-P584">The news had come at lunch, Kepler-37 being relatively close to Galileo, but still quite a distance at sub-light speeds.  News traveled quickly when the magical girls in question traveled faster than light though, the lunchroom distinctly more mirthful than one might otherwise expect.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P584">An authentic <i>victory</i> over the Ceph was incredible, the cafeteria staff had even put out another round of desserts.  Cassandra had never been more relieved to distance herself from her historical namesake, but she couldn’t help shake the feeling of uncertainty.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P585">When will the other shoe drop?  Good always comes with bad.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P586">Cassandra didn’t learn much the rest of the <span>morning i</span><span>n light of her girlfriend’s contract</span>.  How could she?  She was <i>scared beyond belief</i> for Yuki.  <span>Yuki, poor</span><span> Yuki, would be struggling to shove down her feelings, to make it through. She signed up to make a wish,  </span><span>wanting to be understood, </span><span>but the price</span><i> was too high for her.</i>  </div>
<p class="paragraph-P587">Cassandra tried to bury the feeling for a moment, giving up as she felt herself get queasy.  It was one thing to contract and get to say goodbye; that happened enough that people knew to expect it.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P587">She even dreamed of it sometimes, when the nightmares were replaced with a warmth that radiated from her heart, the slightest hint of joy replacing the usual misery.  Getting to go off and make a difference, knowing Yuki would be safer for it.  It was an entirely different thing to find out someone’s wish was <i>for you.</i></p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P588">I wanted to take her to that candy shop in New Florence, the ones where Maria had gotten the <span>konpeitō.  </span>They help me when I get sad… I thought they might help her…  Besides, it’d let me enjoy them more knowing we can share the memory…</div>
<p class="paragraph-P589">She digested her lunch with as much enthusiasm as she could bear.  Her classmates occasionally spared her a knowing glance, more than one pausing to ask about Yuki.  She pretended she couldn’t hear them, she couldn’t tolerate much else.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P589">The seat across from her sat empty.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P590">No more lunchtime chats.  No more whispered secrets.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P591">When instruction resumed, she still got the questions asked of her on the orbital mechanics exam correct.  Mackenzie tried to object, but the results were unarguable.  She made childish faces that Cassandra couldn’t help but but smile at, her concern seeping back in as quickly as it had been suspended.  She, of course, had heard that Yuki was leaving for the front.  It wouldn’t be a secret when her chair was vacant.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P592">How do I sleep at night knowing she made a wish for me?  Do I even trust that she made that wish and didn’t lie to me about it?</div>
<p class="paragraph-P591">Cassandra shook her head, dispelling the thought in an instant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P593">No, she wouldn’t do that.  I suppose me knowing that so absolutely is certainty she didn’t wish for something else.  She could have wished for something awful and I never would have known.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P593">I’m glad she just used it for human connection.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P594">After what felt like an eternity, she heard the dismissal bell, <span>and shuffled to her feet, bag tossed over her shoulder without care.  She was sure that her classmates said bye </span><span>to her</span><span>, but she didn’t hear them.  </span><span>Mackenzie had a chess club meeting later, but she already knew she wouldn’t be attending.  She had a date with her bed and a jar of</span><span> konpeitō </span><span>she </span><span>kept </span><span>hidden </span><span>from her father’s sweet-tooth.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P596">For sad times, something as sweet as you.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P597">Her longing for warm blankets, sweets relief, and a chance to ugly-cry was cut short, the evacuation alarm screaming.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P597">Explosions rocked the building with ease, the bombardment still audible in the distance.  Cassandra couched, her lungs burning as she picked herself off the floor.  Trying to clear her eyes, she found the entryway to the school engulfed in flame.  The world was running in slow motion, screams echoing through the halls in discordant agony.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P598">The glass and steel superstructure of the school had crumpled, the pressure wave sending jagged shards of windows and walls through one another.  Shrapnel drawn through shrapnel, as steel beams were suddenly overloaded, groaning under the <i>redistributed</i> weight.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P599">No emergency mode.  How the hell is this not an emergency?</div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P600"><span>All </span>Cassandra c<span>ould do was </span><span>lurch </span><span>towards the entryway, t</span><span>he Incubator sitting peacefully on the floor as it lay surrounded by the bodies of her classmates. </span><span> </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P601">Through methodical steps, she found herself at the entranceway, her hand skittering across the coarse stone.  She used it to brace herself, grateful that the matriarch had reneged on the design arguments with the choice slipping from glass back to stone.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P602">With reluctance, Cassandra looked down at her classmates’ bloodied bodies.  She hoped her friends were alive, as much pain as they’d be in.  The alternative would be too much to bear for her, the images already seared into her mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P603">Looking back up, she found something staring at her, its presence indisputable.  The Incubator, against all odds, was here for <i>her.</i></p>
<p class="paragraph-P604">It sat neatly in a gap between two of her peers, soot and blood dribbling to the floor as the surface of the alien remained spotless.  It didn’t seem the slightest bit bothered by the deaths around it.  Of <i>course</i> it didn’t.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P602">She <i>knew</i> the Incubator didn’t care about her friends, children and adults alike.  After all, if they possessed no potential at all, they were irrelevant to their entropy-reduction mission. Countless lectures, whispered rumors, and affirmed truths over the years had driven that point home.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P605">She stumbled closer the main entrance, the light outside searing as she found herself staring unmistakably at Cephalopod ships.  The organic-looking craft hung in the fall atmosphere with malice, blue and brown hues on their hull indistinguishable from the markings on some terrestrial amphibians.  The difference, if not for being orders of magnitude out of scale, was the hostility.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P606">Not all Earth animals play with their prey like this.  Some of them have mercy...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P607">Myriad tendrils of debris lazily worked their way towards the ground as smoke billowed up from the fields on the outskirts of town.   They were taking their time, Cassandra shuddering as she remembered her Primary Civics lectures.  They had done the same at New Athens.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P608">They’ll render this rock uninhabitable without a care in the world if things don’t change. </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P609">In the distance, she saw flashes of bright color streaming towards the ships, bursting in air as cacophonous explosions peppered the larger and small craft alike.  <span>Despite best efforts though, the </span><span>frequency </span><span>color-bursts continued to decline, m</span><span>agically summoned barrages</span><span> being replaced </span><span>with more traditional plasma and phased energy weaponry.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P610">Her heart dropped as she watched the smoke on the horizon continue, pale grains being replaced with charred soil, the dried plots gone just as quickly.  Her family, her <i>home</i> were being destroyed, and would be gone in mere moments unless she did something about it.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P611">She turned around to find the Incubator looked at her expectantly, tail swishing.  With weary eyes, Cassandra confronted her future, the one she’d been dreaming and dreading since she had gotten her nightmares.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P612">“Incubator.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P613">Cassandra Harraka.  You have a wish prepared?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P612">“I’m ready.”</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P614">---§---</div>
<p class="paragraph-P615">Cassandra wasn’t quite sure how she knew where the grief cubes were.  She wasn’t sure how she was sustaining the effort.  It was intuitive, as though she had always known where the grief cubes were, the exact bounds of her matter translocation an absolute and unequivocable truth.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P615">In an instant, the ships overhead were razed, more than one simply <i>vanishing</i> from the horizon.  In another, three of the ships mechanically intersected another, the very sinew of reality crying in agony as her will was rendered.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P616">She felt her vision failing, her senses distant as her soul maintained the smallest gossamer connection to her human body.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P617">Guess I’m running on fumes.  Time to end this show.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P616">She took a deep breath, her hair blowing out behind her as she held her hands clasped, as if in prayer, as the sky itself blinked.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P616">It took until nightfall for someone to notice, Mackenzie giving up on her chess matches finally as she sat on the steps of her charred school.  She looked to the stars and found none there, the night sky dark enough to match Cassandra’s despair.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P616">---- &amp; ----</p>
<p class="paragraph-P618">Cassandra was dreaming again, or rather, she wasn’t sure she was awake.  The subtlety wasn’t important in that moment, her feet bare.  She was in the field behind her family home, the warm summer breeze catching her hair.  Or rather, it felt like it.  It couldn’t be it.  That was months, no, <i>years</i> ago.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P618">Her nostalgia could only last so long, the sweet smell of flowers replaced with the unmistakable fascia of someone whose name she could never forget.  A raven-haired girl laying out in the wheat field, peacefully asleep.  She didn’t much care if the crop was ruined; she’d never be harvesting it again after all.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P619">Cassandra inched forward, bit by bit until she was close <span>enough to</span> see the girl’s face.  Uncharacteristically, she was smiling, her eyes closed.  <span>The normal tension on her face was gone, her hands folded </span><span>on her chest, </span><span>soul gem simultaneously empty, full, and absent.  </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P620">I hope your dreams are kind to you.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P619">Cassandra looked around, the pale hues of the field interrupted by a ring around the girl, a trail of red flowers encircling her.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P620">Spiderlilies.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P619">Cassandra plucked one, <span>closing her eyes as she moved to put it behind her ear.  As her hand moved, she felt it change </span><span>between her fingers</span><span>, </span><span>writhing and scaly for a moment, </span><span>before becoming silken and smooth.  </span>It was something else now, it had <i>always been something else.  </i></div>
<p class="paragraph-P620">I’m only borrowing it.  I’ll give them back.  I swear.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P619">She ran her fingers through her hair, her thumb catching on the red ribbon now holding her hair behind her ears.  Repeating the motion, she worked the knots in her hair out, the strands finally yielding as they took on a sheen.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P619">The newly-formed magical girl’s expression mimicking that of the sleeping giant before her, a smile on her face, relief palpable.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P620">I’ll be brave for you, Yuki.  You don’t have to be scared anymore.  </p>

<div class="paragraph-P622">Left, right, left, right, left, right.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P623">August continued onward, as best she could anyways.  Leaning against her was the most famous magical girl in existence.  August, a <i>mundane girl</i> was hauling the <i>First Executive</i> through underground tunnels on the planet she had come to call home.  The magical girl was cold to the touch, something August found deeply concerning.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P623">Akemi Homura was just a girl. A frail, glasses-wearing, time-stopping girl.  And she stuttered like her sister.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P624">Why was she so different from how she’s depicted?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">After what felt like an eternity in the dark, Homura coughed slightly, August pausing at the noise.  Homura leaned away from her, gingerly putting weight back on her recently healed leg.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">“I think I can support myself now…” she mumbled, looking at August with a smile.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">A faint smile, but a smile nonetheless.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">“Okay…” August responded, trying to reconcile the image of the girl in her head with the one seen on the silver screen.  She couldn’t, no matter how she tried.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">“So uh… Akemi-san–” she opened, the girl’s faint smile turning to a frown in an instant.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P624">She… doesn’t see herself as senior or an elder?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">“What did the Incubator mean?  What even <i>is</i> a witch?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">Homura kept her back facing August, walking further away from the witch’s arena.  August groaned and sped up, trying to keep pace.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">“Wait!  I thought magical girls fought <i>demons</i>!  Are witches some secret enemy, like a videogame?  What are they–“</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">Homura’s expression had soured even more, looking at August with the cold demeanor that she’d found so familiar.  It was <i>much</i> more uncomfortable in person.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">“You don’t need to know the answer.” she said, her tone neutral, the message ice-cold.  August continued onwards, belligerent and ignorant to how little Homura wanted to continue.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P625">“<span>Don’t need to know‽ </span>The one that showed up after we got kicked out of the bedroom into the big arena <i>tried to kill me! </i>And it <i>did</i> kill Andrea!”</div>
<p class="paragraph-P626">Homura’s face barely registered as being upset, muted resentment the closest approximation of feeling August could get.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">“You are <i>not</i> the only one who has nearly died to witches.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P625">August’s eyes grew wide, realizing that this wasn’t Homura’s first encounter with a witch.  She knew enough to get away, and she kept her safe in doing so.  She should be off fighting the Ceph, not stuck on some backwater world!</p>
<p class="paragraph-P627">“What… can I do.” August asked expectantly, Homura looking at her with a raised eyebrow. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P628">“The Incubator said I have potential.  I’ll contract if–” she started, looking up to find Homura’s shield mere millimeters from her throat.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P629">“<span>Do you value your life?  Your family, your friends?  If so, you will do no such thing.  </span>This is not a life you <i>want.</i>” she scowled, August gulping nervously, her esophagus gently hitting the razor-sharp edge of the shield.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P629">“They’re liars.  They’ll say what you want to hear to get you to sign your soul away.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P629">“Yeah… otherwise it wouldn’t be trying so hard I guess..” August mumbled, a bead of sweat sliding down her face.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P630">Homura scoffed for a moment, banished her shield, and then kept walking, clearly glancing back to see that August was following her.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P631">Why is she protecting me now?  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P632">The thought wouldn’t leave her mind, no matter how hard she tried.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P633">She’s the most famous magical girl ever, why is she escorting me around?  What happened that she’s here?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P634">Homura didn’t notice the girl thinking, awfully quiet as she kept behind her.  She was too enveloped in her own thoughts, struggling to untangle the web of memories that occupied her waking mind.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P635">Witches aren’t supposed to exist, she made a wish that precludes it.  The Incubator alluded to a conversation that we’d had after she became a concept though, so is she...  No, she couldn’t be.  I’d remember that.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P635">So what happened...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P634">The uneasy silence continued as a venerable chorus played in their minds, each step rhythmic all the same.  After what felt like an eternity, they finally arriving at a green sign with a pictograph of a person running on it, arrows pointing up and to the right. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P635">An exit, finally.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P634">Homura gestured for the girl to go ahead of her, up the stairs.  With painful motions, clearly worn from the distance walked, she climbed up the stairs, the bag on her back swinging slightly as she did so.  After a few steps though, she felt the pouch on the bag open, swinging around to try and stop it as something falling out.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P636">Homura’s eyes were locked on the motion as picked up a small, stuffed crow, not even thinking of it.  It had diamond-shaped eyes, and a skull that resembled a pincushion, small ball-headed pins skewered into it.  As she held it in her hands, she turned it slightly, the glassy black eyes on it catching in the lighting of the tunnel.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P636">She was lost in a memory, the sound of glass shattering all around her.  In an instant, she was keeled over, the first step an insurmountable obstacle as she separated her feeling from her soul gem as quickly as possible.  The same technique that allowed Miki Sayaka to fight with her emotions detached did little to help, the elder magical girl writhing in pain as she braced herself against the wall.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P637">August couldn’t help but watch the girl’s magical girl regalia<i> </i>vanish in an instant, replaced with something black and lacey, something at odds with everything she knew about the girl.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P637">The evocative dress was present for mere moments before morphing into something with iridescent feathers, similar to the stuffed crow she still cradled, another variant of the same outfit, a soul gem hung from her <i>neck </i>instead of her hand.  With another jarring motion, the outfit was replaced with Homura’s iconic purple and gray regalia, the same she’d worn when saving August.  The bow on her head started in a pile of string, re-knitting and repairing itself, utterly disconcerting.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P638">August’s body relaxed for a moment, sighing with relief as Homura laid still for a moment, her gut clenching as the haphazard changes resumed at an even more frenetic pace.  Each shift got her a better look at Homura’s appearance, black opera gloves covering her hands, the sand timer in her shield falling <i>up</i>.  Homura’s voice grew hoarse, the bloodcurdling scream the girl was letting out echoing to a deafening interval against the tunnel walls.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P639">Something was <i>very</i> wrong with Akemi Homura.</p>

<p class="paragraph-P640">As she laid on the floor of her hideaway, string lights twinkling overhead though, she was enveloped in total and complete silence.  For one impossible, dreadful moment, the myriad tensions that pulled at her, that tried to reshape her in the latent image of the First Executive, were gone.  The background static that ate at her so methodically, so <i>precisely</i> had been replaced with a gnawing, indomitable emptiness.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P642">June couldn’t help but shed a tear at the bakery chain she loved being reduced to concrete powder, <span>the wooden sign charred as </span><span>“Cafe </span><span>Salamander.”</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“You serious…” Karina couldn’t help but ask, June nervously rubbing her head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“Sorry… it’s good stuff…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“Was. Was good stuff.” Jenna grumbled, gesturing towards the rubble as another rock fell off the pile.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">Karina rolled her eyes, and gestured to June.  Nodding, the newly-minted magical girl constructed a path over the rubble with ease.  Underfoot, the pink barrier had changed shape, the concentric rings forming a mesh of circles that resembled the pattern left of raindrops on a puddle.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">It also smelled like candy-floss, which Karina was slightly shocked at.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“June… why does your barrier smell like a carnival?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“I’m craving cotton candy… the shield looks like it…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“So what, if you crave acceptance, it smells like a pride parade?” Jenna laughed, Karina snorting as she tried to keep herself from laughing.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“Sorry, sorry!” she admitted, June dissolving the barrier as she stumbles slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“Next time you can broadsword or spear your way over.  Polevaulting, right?” she grinned, leaving her superiors standing awkwardly on the debris.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“Really?  You had to go and piss her off.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“Not my fault!  She’s the cotton candy girl.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P642">“She’s a lot less sweet than that…” she grumbled, using the dull end of her spear to catapult herself over the debris.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P643">The three magical girls kept walking.  While <i>ostensibly</i> their mission demanded stealth, there were so few people that it hardly represented risk.  All the same though, June was still flexing magical muscles as she went, barriers being used in the silliest of ways.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P644">June thought they might chide her, but Jenna and Karina just watched her continue, as they chatted telepathically with one another.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P645">Shouldn’t we be stopping this?  It’s wasteful magic use.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P645">She cut her childhood short to protect her sister.  I think we can give her one more day of being silly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P644">Jenna nodded, glancing upwards as they felt it start to rain.  A chilled, but forgiving rainstorm, the gentle patter underfoot staining the powdered concrete on the terraces.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P644">“Well, that’s annoying…” Karina muttered, looking up as a drop hit her squarely in her eyeball, yelping as Jenna giggled.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P646">With barely a movement though, the three girls were cast in a pink glow, June forming an improvised umbrella from her barrier.  As the rain struck the radiant shield, Jenna heard crystalline chimes, like some ancient musical instrument.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P646">“<span>Huh…” she mumbled, looking up at the pattern of delicate lines and rings </span><span>cast against the empty sky</span><span>, reminiscent of something she had seen a lifetime ago.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P647">It almost looks like…</p>
<p class="paragraph-P648">Don’t even think it.  I see the similarity too.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P649">Somewhere underground, Homura’s eyes fluttered open, tears forming from the pain as she felt something distant and familiar.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P650">Madoka.</p>

<div class="paragraph-P651">Itsumi Kisaki wasn’t doing well.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P652">She was never doing well, of course, but some nights were worse than others.  Most nights she got to simply stay adrift in her own thoughts, memories percolating through a chill wind.  Her family would exchange her soiled grief cubes for fresher replacements, bringing food and drinks.  She was effectively bedridden, so she was spared from the horrors of the outside world.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P652">Tonight was not one of the nights she was spared from the horrors of her own mind.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P651">She was… somewhere else.  Her room, but not her room, the blankets falling away into curtains.  Her home, but not quite so, the walls becoming set-pieces.  To say she was adrift was incorrect; she was <i>moored </i>to this stage, to this time, whether she had wanted to be or not.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P653">It was Shakespeare who so boldly declared that all the world’s a stage, right?  And all the men and women merely players...</p>
<p class="paragraph-P654">The times she tried to avoid her debut on this psychic stage, it arrived all the same.  She was, as with every other time, staring at a magical girl whose identity was… absent.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P654">She knew she didn’t like her, what she <i>meant, </i>what she represented.  Every time she tried, Itsumi found herself unable to place a specific reason why.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P655">At times, she could have sworn there was a name, lingering on her tongue, spite and vitriol as present as dread and misery.  </p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P651">She transformed into her magical girl attire, half-asleep as she found her bedroom <span>substituted for an imitation of it on a</span> vast stage, the sodium vapor lamps heavy on her eyes <span>as they hummed to life</span>.  </div>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P651">“And, action!” an unseen director yelled, <span>the walls </span><span>dissolving as</span> people dressed as wraiths hurried across the worn flooring.  <span>T</span>he <span>familiar </span><span>groans of wraiths sewn into a dissonant </span>wind as she fired off shot after shot.  <span>H</span>er bow<span>line </span><span>grew </span><span>taut </span><span>and slack in cycle </span><span>as she readied each shot, the actors dissolving as easily as the wraiths themselves had </span><span>in her past.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P656">Why am I shooting them?  Why am I on a stage, and who is directing?</p>
<p class="paragraph-P657">After what felt like an eternity, the director shouted “and SCENE!”, the stage lights collapsing to a dim, spare a few lamps scattered around.  Where the bodies of the “wraiths” had lain dormant though, was another figure.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P657">She found herself staring at a girl that looked much like her, magical girl regalia identical, soul gem in the same place, but somehow… distinctly not anyone she knew.  The girl wore a cape, donning a hood that covered her face, shadows occupying the place.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P658">She watched in horror as she readied her own bow, aiming it methodically at the magical girl.  The the string grew more and more tense, the blue-tinged thread beginning to cut through her fingers.  Tighter, tighter yet, the bow creaking under the stress, the faintest glimmer of her blood dripping down her gloved hand.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P658">The bowline snapped, the girl still standing, a blossom of blue splattered across the floor.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P659">If the stranger felt the pain, she didn’t react.  There was no entry wound, nor an exit wound, but the debris laid scattered across the front of house all the same.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P660">“Who are you!” Itsumi yelled, her voice carrying in the empty hall.  No audience in sight, she cradled her still-bleeding hand, the pain an old friend.  The stranger walked towards her, step by step, stopping just out of reach.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P661">The voice seemed to come from everywhere, hushed and deafening all at once.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P661"><span>“I am no one. </span><span> </span><span>I am your sister. </span><span> </span><span>I am the girl you betrayed.  I am your daughters. </span><span> </span><span>I am the ones who came before.</span><span>  </span><span>I am no one.” </span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P661">Each word was layered with whispers, a hiss of some other message, some other voices discordant as Itsumi struggled to make out the true message.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P662">As the words ceased though, Itsumi lurched forward, the stage under her beginning a dizzying and agonizing motion, dragging her further away from the faceless girl.  Each step she took to get closer made the rings spin faster than the last, the girl running towards her, and she still couldn’t close the gap.  She leaped towards the center, the rings accelerating as the girl grew more distant, before being yanked out underfoot, glimmering threads following her into the dark below.</p>
<!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->
<div class="paragraph-P663">Falling, falling, falling, all she could hear was a grotesque laugh.</div>
<p class="paragraph-P664">Itsumi bolted up in her bed, glancing at her soul gem.  Pitch black, spare a single dot of light, her very survival a sign of spite.  She would be granted no escape.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P664">Through bleary eyes, she yawned. </p>
<p class="paragraph-P665">Today of all days, why did I dream of Walpurgisnacht?</p>

<div class="paragraph-P666"><span>Craig</span><span> Riddel closed the privacy curtains to his office, as he latched the door, Leland Paris already reaching over the desk and into his top drawer, revealing a bottle of a liquor older than him.</span></div>
<p class="paragraph-P667">“You knew I kept it in that drawer?” Craig asked, a look of consternation on his face, brushing his beard in dismay.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P667">“You didn’t exactly <i>hide it</i> Craig.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">With a dismissive grunt, Craig walked past him, sitting down at the desk, the chair creaking under him.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">He opened the bottom drawer, revealing two crystalline whiskey glasses.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“And what cemetery did you steal these out of doc?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">Craig grunted again, apparently at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“The one they buried my parents in.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“Burial?  Old-fashioned.  A lot about you is, doc.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">Craig looked at the man, still young, grays not permeating his hair yet, a mop of muted red hair stapled to his skull.  Despite the bags under his eyes, he had a twinkle in his light blue eyes.  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P669">Figures.  He hasn’t seen the worst of it yet.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“I could say the same of you, Mr. Paris.  Who would <i>change</i> their last name to be named after the city of lights, after all?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">Anger flickered across Leland’s brow as he glared at the man a hundred years his elder.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“I wasn’t supposed to live this long, you know?  I was trying to make a joke about London Bridge, Paris falls.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“Bit morbid, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“Says the man who has to confirm the deaths of magical girls.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“Would you believe me if having done so for girls older than me made it easier to stomach?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“No.” Leland said promptly, Craig smirking at the curt response.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P668">“Good. It doesn’t.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">The two men sat in silence for several minutes, nursing their drinks carefully.  It was likely the last time they’d have a “new” bottle of the stuff, sparing wasting the energy on synthesized alcohols.  Neither could spare the thought.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“You see the new girl?  Took to the range like a champ.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“June?  No, she was in practice against Karina and her company.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">Leland snorted slightly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“No way a mundane girl like her beat Karina’s company, what are you on about? Is there more than one new girl?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">Craig nodded.  “June and August.”  </p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“And I suppose their brother is July?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">Craig snorted his drink through his nose, Leland laughing raucously.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“Oh, you’re a <i>historian</i> now, are you?  Maybe you should have made your last name Bradshaw!” he belted, a smile blooming on Leland’s face, before his demeanor yielded a reluctant melancholy.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“I almost <i>did</i> study history you know…”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P671">“Why didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P672">The words left Craig’s mouth before he had a chance to process them, the warmth on Leland’s face gone as quickly as it had arrived.  He didn’t speak for a moment, dozens of thoughts flowing through his head.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P672">“You ever feel like maybe we’re waiting for the world to end?” Leland admitted, Craig looking at him softly, his head gently resting on the desk.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P672">“Yeah.” he said plainly, swallowing phlegm as he continued.  “Some days it feels like it already did too.”</p>
<p class="paragraph-P672">“Yeah…” Leland admitted, looking down ashamedly.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P673">Both dead and alive, until Schrödinger opens the box.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">The two sat in an uncomfortable silence, the quartz glasses gently thudding against the mat on Craig’s desk as he spun the vessel in place.  With a silent nod, he poured another finger of the elixir into his companion’s cup.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“How is–” </p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“I <i>don’t </i>want to talk about her.” Leland spat, Craig’s inquisitiveness replaced with reluctance, nodding knowingly.  Their silence continued, the pulsating beep of a heart-rate monitor in the patient rooms behind him refusing to go away.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P674">I almost got to think it was like old times.  Not the good old days, but a time before...this.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P675">Craig looked up at Leland, his eyes drilling into Leland’s as he peered into his drink.  Neither admitted the obvious, it needed not be said.</p>
<p class="paragraph-P670">“You still want to do dinner tomorrow night?”</p>
