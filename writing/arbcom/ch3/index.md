# Chapter 3 – Heritable Traits

〈These newly formed Matriarchies soon began to develop practices and customs all their own, most notably the tendency of the Matriarchy family name to override all other considerations, for naming purposes, initially for daughters, but later for all descendants. At first, these Matriarchal names were often kept private, until perhaps after a girl needed to fake a death, but later, as the families got more powerful in the outside world, the practice became open, and was often applied retroactively.〉① 
— Julian Bradshaw, "Mahou Shoujo: Their World, Their History," excerpt.

“Power Development is one of a magical girl's most crucial tasks. While every contract comes prepackaged with a set of stereotyped powers and an understanding of their usages, all too often these powers come with inconvenient, unpleasant, or downright dangerous limitations.”
— "Magical Girl Introductory Manual," excerpt.

------------------

Andrea was uncomfortable visiting her mother.  The inexplicable numbness that followed each visit hadn’t gotten easier to tolerate, but she was the one who seemed to endure it best.  After all, family takes care of family, and her obligations *mattered.*

She took a deep breath and unlocked the door to the bedroom.   Stepping through the door quickly, her sapphire-colored eyes glimmered in the twilight ambiance of the room.  From a bed in the center, a voice called to her from behind the canopy.

“Andrea, is that you?” the figure beckoned, the eldest daughter taking careful steps towards the chamber.  Her heels nestled into the low pile carpet with each cautious step before she took a deep breath and responded.  

“Yeah Mom, it’s me.” 

The figure in the bed turned to face her, each move deliberate.  As her mother moved the mesh, Andrea felt her obligation, her past, her present get washed away. She was just a girl answering her mother’s call.

With empty, deep-set eyes the color of sea-glass, Itsumi Kisaki looked at her daughter.  Andrea still found her mother’s eyes vacant, disconcertingly so.  Some distant part of her knew her mother had been this way for weeks, blurring into months.  A twinge of fear shot through her, worrying she might be this way forever, before she managed to bury the feeling.  

The matriarch’s thoughts and memories were even less coherent, the future and past woven into a haggard knot.  Cause and effect, past and present, dream and memory had become an incoherent mess even to her. Her mutterings were difficult to understand even for her own daughter, the two struggling to find words bit by bit.

“I had such a strange dream sweetie.  Our little world was in a snowglobe.” Itsumi mumbled, her hands cupping the air as if the illusory toy might slip through her fingers.
“It sounds beautiful, Mom...” Andrea cooed, her soul gem growing more opaque by the moment.

“And the girl… Cassandra…” Itsumi muttered, looking up at her daughter as Andrea held her mother’s head close.  Andrea took a deep breath, tears hitting her mother’s blue-gray locks, still frizzy and tangled.

“Cassandra will be fine Mom, she’s a strong girl.” Andrea said softly, her mother’s face wracked with anguish.
“I don’t…. no…. She’s to follow in her footsteps.  Already has.” she mumbled, each word from her mother’s mouth an anchor dragging her closer to despair, her own mind clouding more by the moment.

*Focus on the reason you’re here.  Focus on June and August.*

Andrea yielded, her mother looking at her with weary eyes still, as she sat down on the edge of the bed.

“I thought you should know, Stephanie found two more family members.” she said plainly, unable to meet her mother’s eyes.

“Oh?” Itsumi beamed, the words mooring her to reality, if for a moment.

“Who are they, tell me *more!*  Did your brother finally remarry?” she probed, each word said with more intensity than the last.

“August and June.  They were adopted, but one just contracted.  She’s apparently quite good at being magical girl.”

“Another magical girl!  Finally someone to give you a run for your money, eh?”

Andrea was hit with bittersweet nostalgia. She knew full well that she’d been upstaged as the family’s most successful magical girl many years prior.  Now she was simply the oldest.

*So she doesn’t remember Mae… Marion...  Good Goddess, how much of this must I endure…*

Andrea’s cheeks ached from the taut smile, trying desperately to ignore the stench of her decomposing siblings. The fragments of their soul gems laid shattered next to them, their bodies curled up in their last moments.  

She couldn’t panic, she couldn’t worry.  She had to keep it together or she’d be joining them.

“I hope not…” Andrea muttered under her breath, her facade of authority waning.  

*Would she even notice if I broke down?  Is she really that far gone...*

“No matter what, promise me you won’t trust *Akemi* with those girls.  That girl is *wretched*.  A liar, a thief!  Stole her from all of us.” she muttered, eyes rolling back in her head as she collapsed into a mountain of pillows.  Andrea couldn’t help but hold her hand for a moment before getting up.

Andrea quietly hummed to herself a melody from her childhood, opening the nightstand drawer with practiced motions.  She withdrew as a small pile of grief cubes to replace the ones enveloping her mother’s soul gem.  The despair writhed in the cuboid vessel, almost seeming desperate to escape.  

As Andrea watched the despair materialize inside the grief cubes, her mother’s soul gem more vibrant by the moment.  She held a few more cubes to her own her mental acuity sharpened from removing the accumulated despair.  All the while, she couldn’t help but reflect on her mother’s words.

*She stole her from us.*

After what felt like an eternity, Andrea took a deep breath, steeling herself to respond.

“I’ll protect you Mom.  I promise…   I always will…” she whispered, her eyes glimmering.  She *had* to have faith.  The alternative left her mother without a daughter, after all.
Andrea got up, gingerly pocketing the saturated grief cubes, looking at her mother with regret in her eyes.  

Itsumi was already beginning to drift as Andrea withdrew from the bed, the curtain returned to modestly cover the frail matriarch.

Andrea recoiled as the emotions flowed through her like a riptide, her throat tightening involuntarily as she wished could scream.

*Help me, Shannon, please!  Help me!*

Andrea lurched towards the door in terror, falling onto the carpet, doubled over in pain.  With pained motions, she crawled towards the door and away from her mother’s psychic barrage.  Through the agony, she dragged herself along the carpet.  She could barely breathe, much less think coherently.

Andrea’s body finally relaxed as parts of her memory relented, the mental barriers from training returning along-side years of experiences.

“Don’t… do it… Cassandra…” Itsumi mumbled, her voice muffled as her daughter slowly picked herself off the ground.  If Itsumi noticed her daughter’s yell, she showed no signs of it in her dreamlike stupor.  

The agony waned as as quickly as it’d arrived, the memories carried on the suffering fading in time.  She felt like an adult again, once again not looking her age.  With aching steps, she approached the nightstand off to the side of the room and carefully wound a music box.  Admiring the gentle chimes for a moment, she took metered breaths to calm herself, and headed for the door.  

She couldn’t help but glance back at her resting mother from the door, a silent prayer said as she left.  She was none the wiser the most potent of her memories were being kept inside that room, her mother producing a strained smile as a tear rolled down her cheek.

*I hope we find someone to help you soon.  I can’t bear to put you out of your misery.*

She exited the room to find a bearded fellow, a spitting anachronism of a 21st century doctor, staring back at her.

“Craig.” she said firmly, the man’s emotions indomitable.

“Andrea.” he grunted half-heartedly.

“Any changes I missed?” she said, Craig’s demeanor carrying a disconnected calm that, at times, made her want to scream.

“Not really, no.  She’s effectively on house-arrest, same as always.”

“And she’s still going off about her nightmares?”

“When she manages to speak coherently at all...”

“It’s times like these I *wish* my mother wasn’t a telepath…” 

Craig nodded knowingly.

“Unfortunately it’s rarely a choice.  Older magical girls developing related powers is to be expected past a certain age...”

“And you’ve got no other ideas on how to help her?”

“The last girl who tried is *still* in a coma.  Besides, your mother just swore off the only magical girl who could help, if history is any indication.”

Andrea’s face lit up with recognition, struck by the implausibility of it all.

“History” she began, her mind recalled to New Athens in an instant, of an archangel of death saving the colony in a harrowing blast.

“Surely you don’t mean–”

Craig leaned in, his voice barely a whisper.

“She showed up in my infirmary, Andrea.  Akemi Homura is *alive.*”

Andrea’s frail body quivered as she sat down on the seat outside her mother’s bedroom.

“How soon can I–”

“I don’t know where she is now.”

“How could you let her *leave!*”

Her voice was shrill, her hands shaking.  She’d definitely need another grief cube.

“I don’t know how she left, Andrea.  She *vanished*.  One moment she was asleep in the infirmary, the next she had me by the collar suspended mid-air demanding that accursed ribbon.  The moment after she’d disappeared.”

“How could she disappear, you had cameras–”

“I mean she literally vanished Andrea.  It was like she was teleporting.” he opined, Andrea’s eyes narrowing as she reviewed the conversation in her head, recalling her mother’s words the same way one might reflect on a distant memory.

“Guess I’ve got to take up the church’s mission too.” she murmured to no one in particular, Riddel’s bushy eyebrows raised incredulously. 

“You’re going to try and *find her*?  Need I remind you she was in hiding for twenty plus years without being seen *once?*”

“What choice do I have?  It’s *that* or–” 

She didn’t let herself finish the sentence, excusing herself and heading for the elevator bank with a brisk walk.  The elevator near-silently arrived and departed with the girl in tow.  

Dr. Riddel was left alone in the hallway, gently slumped into the wall.  

Sitting across from him was an artist’s rendition of the scene he walked by on his way to the infirmary every morning, the Goddess’ suspension of the Earth, spare one difference.
The sound permeated the wall and doors, a waning matriarch singing a siren’s song as nightmares flowed out of her like a vile ichor.

In the ornate frame, a rendering of Akemi Homura was next to her Goddess, supporting her gentle touch holding the Earth on the left panel of the triptych.  She was acting as her adjudicator by arrow-point in the right pane.

As Craig’s ears betrayed him, the matriarch’s wails piercing his reflection, he stood up and headed towards the elevator. He glanced back only once at the empty center-panel.

*May the Goddess have mercy on all of us.*
