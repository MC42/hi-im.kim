<h2>Raindrop</h2>
<p>And so, she laid awake in the flat, trying not to think about... anything.  the quiet, gentle whir of the bathroom vent tries to suck out the faint smell of weed and salt, her face still covered in tears run dry like riverbeds.</p>
<p>"And just like that..." she said, finally clocking out. </p>
<p>She slowly turned and churned through the night, staring through the unfamiliar blinds into a blurry watercolor of the city before her, strange too, still so foreign to be known, an interloper, until she hears a rattle, and sees a flash of blue and green strands, gossamer streams glowing faintly through the blinds.</p>
<p>And muttering, so much cursed muttering.</p>
<p>"No Jay, this is important, I'm not going to wait around to find her... Yeah I get it." </p>
<p>This interloper of interlopers continued her march up the fire escape to the roof, and well... she was remiss to pass up a chance to escape the unfamiliar ceiling... and her thoughts.  She creaked and groaned more than the window as it stubbornly slid open, and she slid out onto the fire escape, and gingerly followed the lady with gossamer, glowing hair.</p>
<p>As she crept up over the roofline, she found herself staring at someone in a frilly red and white outfit, matching stark white heels, stud earrings and hair that flowed like a rainbow and glowed dimly as if the stars on the roof of homes young past.</p>
<p>She spoke into her phone, while magical girl charms like the anime she grew up watching, as Candy mouthed something to herself.</p>
<p>"The premier... holy shit..."</p>
<p>She listened eagerly to the conversation, hoping her getting mildly drenched in the drizzle would be fine as she noted, impossibly... the faint dome of resistance around the woman.</p>
<p>"Jay... I know she's somewhere in a <em>fifteen</em> mile radius.  It's not like the next one is going to-" she said, Candy's bare feet slipping on the steel of the fire escape as lethargy hit her like a brick, wildly flailing as she slipped away from the front of the fire escape, finding herself staring up at the woman she was admiring so shamelessly.  Her arm was caught perfectly, picturesque in her blunder by someone so beautiful.</p>
<p>"Gotcha." the witch beamed, her smile so soft that Candy finally found someone to compete with her namesake. </p>
<p>"You <em>still</em> didn't explain how you knew my name, Joan." Candy frowned, as she watched the woman's eyes perk up, a delightful green.</p>
<p>She had noticed the clattering behind her as soon as she had hit the roof, and spied the soaked, brown haired girl peering at her.  She stayed silent, so she gave her the benefit of not noticing for a while... and then she slipped.  She had to help, it wasn't a thing she always got the choice in.  She found herself <em>there</em>, having caught her before she knew what she felt about it.</p>
<p>Back in that moment, she pondered her words before responding.  </p>
<p>"Same way you knew <em>my</em> name, Candy."</p>
<p>The girl's face wrinkled, obviously a little confused.  Joan was <em>beyond</em> excited to make a good first impression.</p>
<p>"I must've read it, or something.  You're pretty famous you know."
"Nope.  It's a big secret, my "real identity"... like I can just take this off at the end of the day."
"Then-"
"You used magic."
"Yeah but I'm not a witch, or flying on a broom, or casting spells."
"Not all magic is big or flashy.  Sometimes it's as simple as...  oh shit I don't know..."</p>
<p>"A vibe?" Candy suggests, Joan nodding frantically, her hair caught in the speed of it to twinkle a little more.
"A vibe, yes, exactly!"</p>
<p>"Besides-" she continued, pulling something from the pocket of her outfit underneath the red capelet.  </p>
<p>"The rain stopped on you." she said, Candy glancing up at the thundering sky.<br />
  "That was you."<br />
  "Only a little, dear.  It's two spheres now, not one bigger one.  I expanded it, but <em>you</em> kept it open.  That's not the mark of someone who can't use magic, it's the mark of someone who needs <em>way</em> more training."  </p>
<p>Candy gently scratched at her arms, a chill suddenly very apparent as the wind blew through her thaumic shield, faltering with her faith.  </p>
<p>"You're not the first goddess to say that to me..." 
"Kid... I'm not a goddess.  I'm more human than not, so we've got that in common."<br />
"Besides...  What did the goddess promise?  Love?  Fame?  I've been there, it's kinda shit."<br />
"Peace."<br />
"On Earth."<br />
"In my mind."  </p>
<p>And rather suddenly Candy saw the brightest star in the sky sobbing with her.</p>
