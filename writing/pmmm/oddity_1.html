<p>The time traveler was asleep, or rather, was trying to sleep. Visions
of nightmares swam in her unconscious mind, yet another loop where
everything had gone ass-over-teakettle rather quickly. At the edge of
her conscious mind, she felt a poke, little more than a telepathic
pins-and-needles, a declaration of intent of sorts, and yet it was
enough.</p>
<p>Homura felt the familiar and discomforting pressure of an Incubator
on her torso, transformed and weapon drawn in an instant. The interloper
removed itself with urgency, seemingly aware of the immediate danger it
was in. Where the scenario had diverged was, of course, that the
telepathic carrier was carrying a different voice.</p>
<p><em>Sorry transfer student, this is important. End of the world
important, I know you love that sorta thing.</em></p>
<p><em>What the hell?</em></p>
<p>Homura was staring, rather unceremoniously, at an Incubator with
<em>blue</em> eyes.</p>
<p>She had hoped she could have dismissed it as an abberant Incubator, a
statistical anomaly. Perhaps a body for their collective had splintered,
cursed with the human affliction of individualized emotions. She almost
cherished the thought for a moment, but found herself doubting the
possibility.</p>
<p>After all, the strange Incubator had a soul gem on her neck.</p>
<p>A brilliant blue stone set not in a gold or silver filgree, but a
rough gem wrapped in something almost <em>organic</em>. It was attached
to the white-furred frame by an aquamarine ribbon tied in a delicate
bow.</p>
<p>If the assertion of identity in form of a gemstone hadn’t been enough
on the cabbity frame, the absence of those traditional golden rings
sealed the sheer absurdity of what she was looking at.</p>
<p>“Wh-what? What <em>happened</em> to you Sayaka-chan?”</p>
<p>Sayaka tilted her head, using a manipulator to scratch her head in a
way that unmistakably was <em>imprecise</em>.</p>
<p>“Stuff broke, I guess. This little bubble universe cut a few million
people and a few thousand magical girls off from her wish, and the last
thing we need is Incubators figuring out <em>the secret.</em>”</p>
<p>Her mouth wasn’t moving, emotive thoughts carring over telepathy with
the same cadence and tone as she had when they so unceremoniously had
their spats in that distant past.</p>
<p>“No, I mean… why do you <em>look like that</em>.”</p>
<p>“I had to… uh… improvise? Try not to shoot me on sight please?”</p>
<p>Homura stared down and realized she was, against her better
judgement, still cradling a beretta.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” she mumbled absentmindedly, lowering the beretta such that
if she did fire it, it’d only hit her paws.</p>
<p>“No hard feelings, we fought a lot, right?” the Incubator smiled, a
disturbing warmth carried on a frame typically afflicted by a mortis
smile devoid of emotion.</p>
<p>Sayaka almost seemed <em>remorseful</em> in the moment, but Homura
was despite her best efforts, confused. After all, she was addressing
“the fate of the universe” with the same intonation as a late school
assignment.</p>
<p>“R-Right. So… how do we uh… save the universe?”</p>
<p>“See that’s the problem. I can’t say exactly. I can push my
perspective a <em>little bit</em> beyond causal responsibility but…
there are consequences to messing with time.”</p>
<p>“Causal responsibility? The Sayaka Miki I knew never knew the meaning
of the phrase.”</p>
<p>“The Sayaka Miki <em>you knew</em> had a life expectancy measured in
weeks.”</p>
<p>Homura frowned slightly, creases returning to a face both younger
than it looked and more worn than it should be.</p>
<p>“So you’re borrowing an Incubator’s body, I’m missing major parts of
my memory, and we’re nearly four hundred years and several thousand
light-years from home trying to prevent the knowledge of… you know, from
spreading.”</p>
<p>“That sums it up, I think, yeah.”</p>
<p>If she didn’t know better, if she didn’t know <em>Sayaka Miki</em>
better, she almost sounded smug. She shook her head, realizing just how
hard it was going to be to separate her past from this… development.
Nevertheless, she had to try, for Madoka.</p>
<p>Homura holstered her beloved beretta in her buckler and banished the
set with ease. The esteemed magical girl was left wearing, without
further explanation, a borrowed set of pajamas. She paused for a moment
as she stared down at the pattern on the tee, finding the design both
familiar and melancholy. Deep in thought, she tried and tried to find an
origin, to no avail.</p>
<p><em>Is that… a grief seed? What jerk would put a grief seed pattern
as the logo for a magical girl organization!?</em></p>
<p>Her attention was only seized when she realized, rather abruptly,
that the sweet aroma of pancakes was wafting in from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Oh, and word of advice? Don’t ask for butter on your pancakes.”</p>
<p>“What does—”</p>
<p>“It breaks the timeline. Gotta go, be back later.” she said,
vanishing with the same impunity the Mitakihara Incubator was known for,
leaving the transfer student alone with her thoughts once more.</p>
<p>“Jerk…”</p>
