## Sous-Chef

Akemi Homura was, for lack of a better word, pathetic.  She was sure that others thought it of her, to say nothing of how she saw herself. She had narrowly escaped death on her first day of school, before developing a blisteringly parasocial crush and falling right into end-of-the-world circumstances.  Such was the life of a *mahou shoujo*, she figured.

"Akemi-san, more tea?" Tomoe Mami smiled, her gracious host utterly at ease with the practice.  Homura nodded quickly and flashed a smile, trying her best to forget how her gunfire sounded.  Ever since Homura saw Mami kill a past partner, Homura wasn't sure she could look at her confident, collected mentor *quite* the same way.  Her once-upon-a-situationship had fallen to the ground, body limp after a fatal shot the soul gem.

Homura was terrified, but mercifully, she was better at hiding fear than she was at cooking.

"Akemi-san, could I ask you to help in the kitchen?  Ribbons only go so far for free hands."

This Mami was, thus far, spared the truth that broke her past-future self.  

"O-Of course Mami-san."

Mami gestured towards the kitchen as Homura followed suit, stepping inside the kitchen alcove to reveal an already simmering stockpot.

Homura washed her hands before sliding down to the chopping board at the "station" next to the sink.  

She picked up the knife and weighed it in her hands.  The blade glinted in her hands as she surveyed the instrument.

*Lighter than a Beretta, more elegant than a Desert Eagle or Glock.*

A thought shot through her, more instinctual as anything else.  Where to swing, where to throw, how fast to hurl the blade to strike Mami-san down, should she need to.

"Start with the celery, then the carrots.  If you're feeling bold, there's some melon we can dice up for a treat with lunch tomorrow."

She nodded promptly, and moved her shaking fingers to try and protect her knuckles.  Something she had seen in her cooking of *less than common* substances for her awaiting death at the end of the month.

She dismissed the thought, ashamed of herself. An elegant weapon?  No, the knife was a requisite tool and little more.

*At least learning to cook properly might make me a little less useless.  Madoka can work and I'll—*

She began with the celery and quickly fell into a rhythm, hoping the blush on her cheeks faded quickly.

Kyoko was crashing on Homura's couch.  Until ten minutes prior to her asking, she hadn't _had_ a couch; mercifully she could *obtain* one quickly.  The JSDF staff office had one that was seldom used, and it was more likely to be taken as a prank than anything else.

Besides, she hadn't stolen any guns this loop through yet.  

Luckily, she was already in the habit of turning off the holo-projectors when they weren't in use.  Otherwise, her sterile isolation void might have dissuaded the street smart Kyoko from taking shelter from the first wave of rain.

"S-Sorry about the mess."

"Beats the street. I've had worse when I was at th—"  she began, cutting herself off as she chomped down onto her Rocky.

Homura (smartly) chose to not push her on where she got the Pocky when she was between, well, everything at the moment.

"Oh, Kyoko-san—"

"Akemi... Can it with the honorifics. We're just girls."

[ homura wakes up to find her cooking breakfast. ]

[ what are you doing? ]

[ I slept at yours.  Only fair. ]

[ This... seems unexpectedly generous. ]

[ Parents raised me right y'ass.  (enraged)]

[ I never said anything about your parents. ]

[ Well when the times were good, y'know, momo and i would help our mom with the baked goods, anything to get congregants to stick around. ]

[ Did it work...? ]

[ Kinda.  Folks kept comin' but they never stuck around.  And the uh... when my father found out about my wish. ]

[ I'm sorry. ]

[ So what was yours for? ]

[ she doesn't respond quickly.  she just keeps working on the dough. ]

Homura desperately wished she had goggles.  Even with her glasses rested firmly in the pocket dimension of her buckler, they would have done little to protect her from the barrage.  

The onions were *potent*, far beyond anything Mami-san had as an ingredient in prior loops.  She practically lurched when she first split one open.  But no, Mami had *happened* across a girl on the street and felt it her moral duty to help.   And so, they were cooking a generous portion of pasta for the girl and her community, damn her idealistic heart.

Homura made quick work of onions and set them to simmer, before squeezing in a gratuitous blob of tomato paste.  

"Tomoe-san, I believe the sauce is set for an hour or two."

Mami was still deep in the baking process, attempting to make cookies as a desert en-masse.  Blob after blob of cookie dough sat chilling in the fridge, unexpectedly full for the first time in many years.  

Her apartment kitchen may have been luxurious by most standards, but despite her ambitions, it was still bursting.

While washing her hands, Mami couldn't help but smile at the result of her work, sliding the last sheet pan of cookies into the freezer.

"Sounds like enough time to put on a movie and some tea.  Kyoko, would you like anything?"

Homura washed her hands in turn and made her way to the couch, Kyoko responding with a dissinterested grunt.

"I'll take that as a no then."

"Th' hell is your deal anyways?  Isn't there some big bad witch comin' t' town?  Isn't like... getting grief seeds more important than yer lil' domestic thing?"

She had a frown on her face, slightly more irate than usual.  Walpurgisnacht *would* arrive in eight days; she was right.

Homura couldn't help as a twinge of guilt coarsed through her.   Walpurgisnacht *would* arrive in eight days; she was right.  She had *sworn* not to rely on anyone else so authoritative, and here she was...

But she wasn't dependent on anyone else, she told herself.  

*I need this.  We both need this. All of us do.*

The charity cooking was essential if it kept Tomoe Mami alive long enough to fight Walpurgisnacht.  If. Homura was merely opting to do *additional* good in the process.  

"Yes.  Walpurgisnacht is arriving soon, but cooking helps me collect my thoughts.  As does food help you with yours."

Kyoko scoffed in response as she ripped open another box of Rocky.

Homura swiftly moved to avoid a train of thought so ruinous it might still catch her in the blast radius.  A thought so treasonous that it might kill her.  The very simple idea that she missed her *senpai*.  

Then again, she knew if she had explained the circumstances that Madoka would be supportive.  She always was, even if she usually contracted afterwards...  

*It's not cheating, we're not even dating!*

Homura resolved to ask Madoka for tomatoes from her father's garden next loop, figuring the pasta for her small group of friends would be ever the tastier.

*It's not quite a dinner date, but—*

She took a deep breath on the couch, and enjoyed her stolen peace.

[ Loop 33 - she totally fucks up a super long cooking dish.  Keeps calling apart.  Mami asks her to step out of the kitchen while she cleans up ]

Homura goes to reset and paused when mami arrives with a very beat up musket.  

She starts to clean her guns habitually.  Mami asks if she can clean her muskets.  "But they're magic"

"So is teamwork, akemi-san."

Loop 45, kyokō is revealed to be an excellent chef when cooking in high quantities.  She blames it on the church.  She refuses to do sweets though... (Momo)

[End of September, Homura asks Mami and Kyoko for help baking a cake.  She doesn't need help, but she needs the company. ]

[ She sings happy birthday to Madoka. ]
