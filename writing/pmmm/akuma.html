<p>The transfer student nodded quietly as she did her classwork, not ignorant to the fact her peers kept sneaking glances at her while she was focusing on her work.</p>
<p><em>Fifteen, carry the five…</em></p>
<p>Some cold corner of her mind spewed insults at her all the same, assuring her she <em>wanted</em> to be the center of attention so badly.</p>
<p><em>Gold ribbons, gold, what were you thinking? It’s too bold, too flashy, too attention-seeking. You’re not one of those chuunibyos are you?</em></p>
<p>She shook her head and continued with her work. Intrusive thoughts wouldn’t get them done any quicker, unless the nagging of her subconscious was a maths protégé.</p>
<p>Homura continued to watch her beloved, utterly entranced as she continued through her utterly mundane life. And what a mundane life it was, careful attention given to her “time in America”, to taking up ballet with grace and sophistication. Homura was hopeful that the story she’d crafted would live up to the brilliant woman she’d get to become.</p>
<p>If only she had the chance the first time. Homura permitted her attention to drift from her body in the Mitakihara classroom, only when she felt absolutely confident there were no lingering threats. Her being able to move through the world like shadow was a fairly recent revalation all the same, and one she was sure she obtained by pure happenstance.</p>
<p>A just universe would never have rewarded her with power for her sin. A universe with kindness was dead after what she had done.</p>
<p>She sighed quietly, as she summoned her beloved’s weapon, an indefinite loan given the circumstances, and got to work. Somewhere in the American heartlands, she had wraiths to exterminate.</p>
<hr />
<p>Madoka turned around and found her Homura-chan fallen asleep, and a faint smile spread across her lips.</p>
<p>She <em>did</em> seem tired, after all, no matter what, even when she was elegant or confident, she still seemed… <em>so tired</em>.</p>
<p><em>Madoka.</em></p>
<p>Her head spun as if on a swivel as she tried fruitlessly to find the source of that unfamiliar voice. Instead of finding a source to that uncanny, child-like voice, she found Sayaka Miki. Her childhood best friend slapped her hand on her desk, laying claim to her lunchtime attention.</p>
<p>“C’mon Madoka. We’re getting food. There’s <em>no way</em> you’re getting out of your stories in the <em>Americas</em> that easily!”</p>
<p>“O-Oh! Okay Sayaka-chan… Just…” she murmured as she stood up, glancing back at the still sleeping Homura.</p>
<p>“Come <em>on!</em> If Hitomi gets to start yammering about Kyouske she’ll <em>never stop!</em> Sayaka pleaded, tugging gently on the cuff of her uniform.</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan, stoppp!” Madoka yelped, as she left the raven-haired girl asleep at her desk.</p>
<p><em>I hope she feels better soon…</em></p>
