"H-Hello..." Homura mumbled, nervously approaching the figure as it turned to face her, body contorting as it swiveled around.  

*It almost looks like...*

The girl opened her mouth, a sharp, chittery laughter being let out.  the noise was strange and offputting, only rivaled by the voice in the back of her mind, a whisper that sounded like doubt.

"Ai has returned!" it babbled at her, malice on its face before replaced so easily with a warm smile. 

"A fake, a copy, a sham!"

The words refused to align, the figure growing more distinct as the figure's shadowy appearance dripped off as if oil, replaced with a disconcerting felted texture.

"Wh-what?  I don't know what's going on-"

"Exactly like mistress to think she's back in charge so easily.  Not today!"

The Clara doll beamed a rickets smile as she summoned her oversized needle.  

*Figures*.

As she began her attack, Homura leapt to the side, collapsing in a pile as the doll so eagerly tried to keep pace.

"Mistress will be easily defeated, so give up!" Ibari declared so confidently, arrogance dripping off of the end of the needle as if a sword blade.  Homura was sure that if the blade so much as touched her, it would kill her.  The blackened needle shone with a polish, glittering colors of emotions she had forgotten so easily.

Homura reached into her buckler and produced a gun different to the one she had entered it, her trusty beretta back from beyond the pale.  She squeezed two shots off at the torso of the doll as it dove towards her, the fascimile of a bipedal human not slowed in the slightest by the two jagged holes in its torso.

"Wh-What are you?"  Homura muttered, cradling her bleeding hand the doll ripped the gun out of it.

"You know what I am." Ibari sneered, before getting frustratingly close to the scared magical girl, and if for a moment, touched her soul gem.

The doll collapsed, leaving Homura alone as a confused Karina stared on.

"What was that?" she asked in horror, as Homura looked at her with a steeled look.

That was one of my familiars."

"A familiar?  I don't know what that _is_."

Homura looked at her with the type of weariness only memories could deliver her to.

"I do, and we have a lot of work to do."
