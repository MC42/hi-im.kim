The railyard was largely empty, late night service more than suspended in light of the ceph attack months prior; nobody had it in them to mark the service as truly extinct yet.

"H-Hello..." Homura mumbled, nervously approaching the shadowy figure as they stared off into the surf of the Mitakihara port.  In the chill of the fall, the hooks on the cranes swung in the port winds.  

Despite the flood lights shining like beacons, the figure before them was bathed in shadow, its body contorting as it swiveled around to face her.  

*Stay back, Karina.*

*Don't have to tell me twice.*

Homura continued her approach, watching the figure with concern as she struggled to identify why it felt so familiar.  If for lack of a better term, her *magic* knew this stranger, and she was confused as to why.

*It almost looks like...*

The stranger opened her mouth, a sharp, chittery laughter being let out.  It produced sounds no human nor magical girl should be capable of making.  The noise was strange and offputting, the wind backing it only beaten by the voice in the back of her mind, a whisper that sounded like doubt.

"Ai has returned!" it grimmed at her, malice on its face before being replaced so easily with a warm smile. The smile was more threatening.

"A fake, a copy, a sham!" the doll insisted, its mouth moving at odds with the whispers that snuck into Homura's mind as she recoiled in fear.

The words refused to align, the figure growing more distinct as the figure's shadowy appearance dripped off as if oil, replaced with a disconcerting felted texture.

"Wh-what?  I don't know what's going on-"

"It's exactly like mistress to think she's back in charge so easily.  Not today!"

The Clara doll beamed a rickets smile as she summoned her oversized needle.  

*Figures... I didn't want to fight anyways.*

As [Ibari](https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Rebellion_Material_Book#:~:text=Ibari) began her attack, Homura leapt to the side, collapsing in a pile as the doll so eagerly tried to keep pace.

"Mistress will be easily defeated, so give up!" Ibari declared so confidently, arrogance dripping off of the end of the needle as if a sword blade.  Homura was sure that if the blade so much as touched her, it would kill her.  The blackened needle shone with a polish, glittering colors of emotions she had forgotten so easily.

Homura reached into her buckler and produced a gun different to the one she had entered it, her trusty beretta back from beyond the pale.  She squeezed two shots off at the torso of the doll as it dove towards her, the fascimile of a bipedal human not slowed in the slightest by the two jagged holes in its torso.

"Wh-What are you?"  Homura muttered, cradling her bleeding hand.

"You know perfectly well *what* I am." Ibari sneered, before getting frustratingly close to the scared magical girl.  The doll slowed down, arrogantly circling her progenitor.  She stared at her her with contempt, not even attempting to maintain the facade.  

Exactly what Homura expected from her own arrogance.

She moved quickly to fire at the construction crane overhead, the beretta becoming a pulsed laser weapon again for a moment as the steel cable vaporized in an instant.  The detrius hit the doll like a freight train as the dust settled.  

After what felt like an eternity, a small puddle of something iredescent squirmed across the concrete of the port, lurching towards Homura as she turned to move.

The not-quite-liquid shot through her hand and stopped at her soul gem, the radiant purple stone coated in an opalescent sheen.

Homura was left alone, a confused Karina watching from a distance as a thought shot through her.  

Arrogantly, perhaps, she held out her hand and attempted to summon the doll's needle-sword.  That same blade restedly comfortably in her hand as Karina watched, jaw agape.

"What *was* that?"

Homura looked back at her through weary eyes.

"That was one of my familiars."

"A familiar?  What even *is that*?"

Homura looked at her peer with the type of exhaustion only memories could deliver to her.

"It's a relic. Something from... before.  We have a *lot* of work to do."
