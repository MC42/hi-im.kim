The railyard had remained empty, late night service more than suspended in light of the attack months prior.  Nobody *quite* had it in them to mark the service as extinct yet, and so the rails remained largely unridden.  

Karina watched her elder, a meager shadow of her future past self, slowly approach the stranger.  When they had set out to investigate the irregularity, she had refused to identify herself telepathically.  Nevertheless, the pair remained vigiliant; she still unmistakibly *stank* like magical girl.  

Homura had a nagging feeling of familiarity as she traversed the rails towards their terminus, leaps and bounds covering the dense port with ease.  It didn't feel like a wraith at *all*, and that was itself noteworthy, even if she couldn't place what it *did* remind her of.

*Stay back, Karina.*

*Don't have to tell me twice.*

"H-Hello..." Homura mumbled as she nervously approaching the stranger, utterly indifferent as their head remained firmly fixed on the choppy surf of the Mitakihara port.  Her braids were caught in the wind, ignorant to the chill of the fall.  The hooks on the cranes swung in those sympathetic winds, creaking as they waited for a response of any kind.  

Despite the flood lights shining like beacons, the figure before her was bathed in shadow, glittering slightly as those same torches outlined the figure perfectly.  Marionette joints held its limbs together, body contorting as it swiveled around to face her finally.  

Homura continued her approach, creeping towards the figure with trepidation, struggling to identify why it was *oh so familiar.*  If for lack of a better term, her *magic* knew this stranger, and she had no idea why.

*It almost looks like...*

The stranger opened its mouth, a sharp, chittery laughter being let out.  A mechanical, raspy tone that sounded like a dying dog, nails on a chalkboard, a squeaky door, all at once.  The noise was offputting and coarse as-is, and yet the scene continued to change.  Homura spun wildly as a voice, different but the same, hissed in the back of her mind; a familiar whisper called doubt.

"Ai has returned!" it babbled at her, malice on its face before being replaced so easily with a warm smile; The smile was more threatening as it continued its tirade.

"No, this is a replica!  A fake, a copy, a sham!" the doll continued, its mouth moving in a discordant harmony.  Approximate lips followed those same raspy whispers as Homura staggered backwards just a few steps.

The words refused to fit into its mouth, the figure growing more distinct as the shadowy cloak slid off as if oil, replaced with a disconcerting felted texture.

"Wh-what?  I don't know what's going on—"

"It's exactly like Good-For-Nothing to think she's back in charge so easily.  Not today!"

The Clara doll beamed a rickety smile, summoning her oversized needle.  

*What does a fake doll even mean?*

As [Ibari](https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Rebellion_Material_Book#:~:text=Ibari) began her attack, Homura leapt to the side, collapsing into a pile as the doll so eagerly tried to keep pace.

"Mistress will be easily defeated, so give up!" Ibari declared ever so confidently, arrogance dripping off of the end of the needle as if a sword blade.  

Homura was *sure* that if that blade so much as touched her, it would kill her.  The blackened needle shone, glittering colors of emotions she had forgotten oh-so-easily.

Homura reached into her buckler and produced a gun different to the one she had surrendered to it, her trusty beretta procured with all the bravado of a failed circus.  She squeezed two shots off at the torso of the doll as it dove towards her, the fascimile of a bipedal human not slowed down in the slightest.

"Wh-What are you?"  Homura muttered, cradling her now-bleeding hand as she kicked at the marionette.

"You know *what* I am.  You *made me* what I am!" Ibari sneered, before getting disturbingly close to the scared magical girl.  She scrambled to her feet, the doll slowing down as it circled her, Homura's hand trembling.  The doll stared at her with contempt, dispelling any attempt at maintaining the facade.  

Exactly what Homura expected from her own arrogance.

She moved quickly to fire at the construction crane overhead, the beretta becoming a pulsed laser weapon again for a moment as the steel cable turned to molten slag.  Homura leapt out of the way in an instant.  The detrius hit the doll like a freight train, crushed completely under the weight as the dust settled.  

Only once she saw that the pile had settled, the rubble not seeming to move an inch, did both girls relax.

Karina began to walk towards her, confusion an unexpected look on her face, as she stopped and pointed.  A small puddle of something iredescent squirmed across the concrete of the port, lurching towards Homura as she turned to run.

The not-quite-liquid shot *through* her hand and stopped just short of her death.  The amalgamate sept in, the radiant purple stone coated in an opalescent sheen.

Homura was left alone, a confused Karina watching from a distance as that same whisper coaxed to her to be so bold once more.  

Arrogantly, perhaps, she held out her hand and attempted to summon the doll's needle-sword.  That same weapon rested comfortably in her hand as Karina watched, jaw agape.

"What *was* that?"

Homura looked back at her through weary eyes.

"That was one of my familiars."

"A familiar?  What even *is that*?"

Homura looked at her peer with the type of exhaustion only memories could be deliverance for.

"It's a relic. Something from... before.  We have a *lot* of work to do."

---

"Okay no, stop.  You *cannot be serious right now.  You fought a...a... *thing* that felt like a magical girl, who got crushed under construction debris because your gun can *shapeshift*.  It was made of *felt*!   What the *hell* is going on with you?"

Homura looked at Karina, clearly at the end of her rope, and shrugged.

"It's magic.  Don't expect everything to have a clear answer."

*And even then, would you believe me if I tried to explain that I defeated my own arrogance in a fight?  And that all it afforded me was memories of my own death?*

"Clear answer, my *ass!*  That's not something magical girls *do*!" she balked, stomping towards Homura with an indignance that reminded her of a child.

Karina grabbed Homura's hand, her soul gem still glittering with a subtle sheen that glittered in the floodlights as Homura writhed slightly.

"See, it looks like there's another *layer* in it... on it?  It shot through your hand anyways, are you-" Karina stopped abruptly, realizing that despite clearly seeing the creepy goo punch through her palm, there was hardly a mark on it.

She was *fine*.

"Karina...  there are things in this world I can't explain."

"Try me."

"No.  Absolutely not, it's haunting _me_ in ways I doubt would seem sane if I tried to explain."

"Why the hell can't you just *trust someone* for once!"

Homura had no response to her outburst but resignation.  She slumped over slightly and rocked on her feet, as if caught by the port breeze.

"I don't know... I think... I was something else before... before..." she mumbled.

Karina was besides herself.  The esteemed magical girl was flickering between the brilliant figure that was etched into the annals of time and a scared, nervous girl, even as she stood there.

She felt, for the first time since her wife had died, nervous.  She didn't know what to do.

She watched Homura's soul gem, still shining as though she hadn't been in a fight, as short as it was.

Untainted by the slightest hint of despair.

*What would Shannon do?*

She shook her head and wrapped her arm around the nervous girl, walking out of the port in lockstep.  Neither girl looked at their shadows, ignorant to the fact one of them had changed shape.  <!-- --->
