"H-Hello..." Homura mumbled, nervously approaching the figure as it turned to face her, body contorting as it swiveled around.  

*It almost looks like...*

The girl opened her mouth, a sharp, chittery laughter being let out.  the noise was strange and offputting, only rivaled by the voice in the back of her mind, a whisper that sounded like doubt.

"Ai has returned!" it babbled at her, malice on its face before replaced so easily with a warm smile. 

"A fake, a copy, a sham!"

The words refused to align, the figure growing more distinct as the figure's shadowy appearance dripped off as if oil, replaced with a disconcerting felted texture.

"Wh-what?  I don't know what's going on-"

"Exactly like mistress to think she's back in charge so easily.  Not today!"

The Clara doll beamed a rickets smile as she summoned her oversized needle.  

*Figures*.

As she began her attack, Homura leapt to the side, collapsing in a pile as the doll so eagerly tried to keep pace.

"Mistress will be easily defeated, so give up!" Ibari declared so confidently, arrogance dripping off of the end of the needle as if a sword blade.  Homura was sure that if the blade so much as touched her, it would kill her.  The blackened needle shone with a polish, glittering colors of emotions she had forgotten so easily.

Homura reached into her buckler and produced a gun different to the one she had entered it, her trusty beretta back from beyond the pale.  She squeezed two shots off at the torso of the doll as it dove towards her, the fascimile of a bipedal human not slowed in the slightest by the two jagged holes in its torso.

"Wh-What are you?"  Homura muttered, cradling her bleeding hand.

"You know what I am." Ibari sneered, before getting frustratingly close to the scared magical girl.  The doll slowed down, arrogantly circling her progenitor.  She stared at her her with contempt, not even attempting to maintain the facade.  

Exactly what Homura expected from arrogance.

Homura moved quickly and fired at the construction crane overhead, the steel cable snapping in an instant.  The detrius collided with the doll in an instant, the small puddle of something iredescent squirmed across the floor and towards her, puncturing her hand as her soul gem turned darker.

Homura was left alone, a confused Karina watching from a distance as a thought shot through her.  

Arrogantly, perhaps, she held out her hand and attempted to summon the doll's needle-sword.  That same blade restedly comfortably in her hand as Karina watched, jaw agape.

"What *was* that?"

Homura looked back at her through weary eyes.

"That was one of my familiars."

"A familiar?  What even *is that*?"

Homura looked at her peer with the type of exhaustion only memories could deliver to her.

"It's a relic. Something from... before.  We have a *lot* of work to do."
