<hr />
<p>Kaname Junko <em>hated</em> the pouring rain, huddling in the bus stop with her classmate. Her prayer for the next bus to arrive on time took the form of half-enunciated swears, but Kazuko didn’t mind. The area around school was under construction as of late, and despite best efforts, their escapes home tended to be unpredictable at the best of times.</p>
<p>“It’ll either arrive in eight minutes, fifteen, or not at all.”</p>
<p>Junko scowled back at Saotome Kazuko, ever the persistent bookworm she was. She had memorized most of the timetable through force of habit, and sheer force of will. Junko couldn’t help but admire her a little for it.</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>“Next time when I <em>tell you</em> to pack an umbrella, actually <em>get one</em> please?”</p>
<p>“How was <em>I</em> supposed to know a little rain turned into a typhoon!” she yelped, gesturing wildly at the torrent outside of their meager bus shelter.</p>
<p>“Same way as everyone else… listen to the weather report! Or ask your parents, <em>something!</em>”</p>
<p>Junko remained silent, sulking as she digested just how <em>right</em> Kazuko was and how <em>little</em> she wanted to admit it. This back and fourth, knives-out dalogue was emblematic of their friendship, or at least Junko thought so. Many assumed the bookish girl to be intelligent and reserved; Kazuko scarcely resembled their presumption, doubly so in the wrong company.</p>
<p>When their tempers got the best of them, at the end of it all, they broke bread over sweets and treats. The practice had their stressors assuaged temporarily by shitty ramen and snacks, none of it compliant with rules made by “self-concieted assholes”.</p>
<p>And so, where Junko <em>conveniently</em> forgot to tell her family that the principal had called her a delinquent, Kazuko <em>conveniently</em> went home with some reading materials that a girl of her upbringing probably wouldn’t have otherwise. Her parents didn’t want her reading anything “indecent”, and so she “didn’t”.</p>
<p>They had each others backs, and that’s what mattered. They both cherished their friendship, even if they did still butt heads about boys.</p>
<p>“So, how was fencing?”</p>
<p>“Same as usual. Kicked some ass.” she grinned wildly, Kazuko rolling her eyes at the bravado.</p>
<p>“And that means <em>losing</em> half your matches?”</p>
<p>“Who told you that!? I went 5-3 today!”</p>
<p>“So you got your ass kicked too, hm?”</p>
<p>“Take it back or I’ll add <em>you</em> to my list of defeats!”</p>
<p>A fiendish smile broke out across Kazuko’s face, her eyes obscured by the droplets of rain that hit her glasses.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t stab an unarmed woman, would you?”</p>
<p>“You’re not gonna <em>have arms</em> if you keep making fun of me!” she yelped as Kazuko laughed at her, the pair giggling as she swung her limp arm like a puppet.</p>
<p>“Oh no, <em>my arms!</em> What ever will I do, I’ll have to tell Tomohisa that the wild swordsman Junko has disarmed me!” Her voice was dripping with sarcasm as Junko’s rage began to percolate.</p>
<p>“H-Hey, wait! Don’t you dare bring him into this!”</p>
<p>She raised a threatening eyebrow in response as Junko collapsed onto the bench in a disgruntled pile.</p>
<p>Kazuko smugly hummed a victory theme as her partner in crime conceded.</p>
<p>“Truce?”</p>
<p>“Truce.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness. I don’t want my stuff to get <em>soggy</em> in a fight anyways.”</p>
<p>“Where the hell <em>is</em> this bus anyways?” she muttered, as a beat-up bus slowly curled the corner and arrived at the bus stop just in front of the school.</p>
<p>“Fucking finally.” Kazuko admitted candidly, Junko nodding with a weak recognition. She was <em>exhausted</em>.</p>
<p>The pair collapsed into their seat, and the regular hum of the bus lulled them to sleep.</p>
<hr />
<p>The quiet scraping of something in the bus woke Kazuko up, their ride home abruptly coming to a halt. She fixed her glasses, shaking slightly as she realized that the front of the bus was <em>gone</em>. Not messy, not blurry, <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>“Junko. Junko, wake up…” she muttered, elbowing her as Junko drowsily jabbed back.</p>
<p>“C’mon Kazuko, I was sleep— Wait, I was <em>sleeping</em>? What the…”</p>
<p>Junko stared in disbelief towards the front of the bus, a strange box leaving a trail of white powder as it inched towards them. She was, to say the least, a little more than a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p><em>It almost looks like… a sugar cube?</em> </p>
<p>Junko grabbed her fencing kit and schoolbag as Kazuko stood on the seats, the girls carefully avoiding the white cuboid as they advanced towards the front of the bus. Kazuko <em>would</em> have validated their tickets, had there been a “front door” to depart through; alas.</p>
<p>She sighed and carefully avoided the jaggged metal edges of the bus, ripped open like a can of fish; She <em>really</em> didn’t want to meet the cat that opened theirride like sardines.</p>
<p>They were, distinctly, not in Mitakihara anymore. The peaceful, if somewhat run-down port that the bus ran through before cutting back inland had been replaced rather abruptly. What once was the odor of fish and diesel had been supplanted by a jarring landscape of paper trees in bold colors, discordant chimes from what sounded like a music box, carried on a saccharine wind.</p>
<p>“What… is this place…”</p>
<p>“I… don’t know…” Junko responded nervously. “There isn’t a fair or anything… Our bus driver didn’t crash or something?”</p>
<p>She surveyed the technicolor landscape and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t sound like any heaven I’ve ever been told about…”</p>
<p>Junko gulped nervously.</p>
<p>“How ’bout the other place?”</p>
<p>“Neither has construction paper trees or dog-sized sugar cubes…. if I paid attention in bible study anyways.”</p>
<p>Neither girl wanted to think about what happened to the bus driver, and so they didn’t. Mortality was not easy to stomach, though the sweets surely would be easier to in a bind.</p>
<p>“Well we must be <em>somewhere</em>. Let’s keep looking for an exit, or a sign, or something…”</p>
<p>When they had boarded, it was just them and the bus driver, as was usual for their route home. Neither girl had expected an adventure, and both desperately wanted an escape. Instead, as they wandered, all they found were more oddities.</p>
<p>Each step forward felt like two steps back, every mistake or error compounding as the many limbs of the world conspired to nip at them.</p>
<p>The bark of the trees may have yielded like felt, but it was still too stiff to push aside when they hit a dead-end. The leaves were made of something like construction paper, burning as it cut gashes into their skin; she almost wished it was an ivy or nettles. Least of all was the strange sugar cubes, replacing the terrain where rocks and pebbles might be, all while it seemed coarser and stiffer than any sugar cube she’d ever added to tea before. Then again, sugar cubes had no place in macha, and the pair of girls had no place in this strange, repulsive world that so clearly hated them.</p>
<p>The sky itself obscured the passage of time as minutes stretched into hours, a thick haze casting the world into a perpetual twilight. And so, rather confidently, Junko concluded aloud that the world must hate them. Worse yet, in a moment of startling harmony, Kazuko agreed with her.</p>
<p>“Sure feels that way.”</p>
<p>Their first encounter with the native species of this land had been about the size of a cat, seemingly one of thousands as they continued to roam. While they had seen stationary and slow moving sugar cubes to this point, they seemed harmless enough; how they were wrong.</p>
<p>“This is… too much…” Kazuko insisted, sitting down on the cube nearest to her in dismay. As her hands brushed against the surface of the cubeoid she recoiled in horror.</p>
<p>The glittering surface had clung to her hands slightly; a saccharine layer peeling off when she had expected coarseness like sandpaper.</p>
<p>“They <em>are</em> sugar cubes, what the hell?” she mumbled as she sniffed at her hands, the sugarcube fracturing into pieces underneath her weight.</p>
<p>Junko leapt back to her feet as Kazuko jumped towards her, her momentary seat yielding jagged teeth where her body had been mere moments prior.</p>
<p>She didn’t even have time to yell before Kazuko kicked the cube onto its side. The creature writhed, unable to right itself, other cubes nearby responding to the crunching of sucrose teeth with sympathetic gnashing, heading towards the girls.</p>
<p>“We <em>gotta go!</em>” Junko screamed, the pair running deeper into the pastel forest, blissfully unaware of an interloper. Perched neatly on the floor beneath a tree with fruit that looked like porcelain, was a beady-eyed cabbit. </p>
<hr />
<p>As the girls sprinted through the forest, the trees began to form patterns, guiding them forwards and backwards, through areas that seemed to double back on themselves.</p>
<p>The forest itself seemed to be playing tricks on them.</p>
<p>“So… we know the lil’ cubes are ANGRY.”</p>
<p>“THEY HAVE TEETH WHY DO THEY HAVE TEETH” she yelped, cradling herself as she rocked on the ground slightly.</p>
<p>“DON”T ASK ME!”</p>
<p>As the path ran into a corner, the girls progress through the maze ground to a screeching halt. Junko spun in circles once or twice, desperate to find a way through as the trees converged into a path too narrow to escape through.</p>
<p>They were trapped.</p>
<p>“Okay so… no path forward… What do we do…”</p>
<p>“They’re… sugar cubes. Water dissolves sugar.”</p>
<p>“I have a half liter of water from fencing practice.” she declared triumphantly, her reaction tempered by the realization that might defeat <em>one</em> sugar cube, not thousands.</p>
<p>“My water bottle is empty…”</p>
<p>“Kazuko!”</p>
<p>“<em>What!</em> I always empty it before I get on the bus so I’m not hauling around water! My bag is heavy <em>enough</em>!”</p>
<p>“Ugh… what else do we have? I have my sabre, but that’s not good for, y’know, <em>fighting fighting</em>.</p>
<p>“It’s better than a <em>lack of umbrella…</em>”</p>
<p>“Right, the umbrella!” Kazuko exclaimed, before extending it into a makeshift baton.</p>
<p>“If they get close, bat at ’em with this!”</p>
<p>“And what if I can’t hit them… I’m not… sporty like you.”</p>
<p>“Then just open the umbrella! Maybe they’ll bounce off!” she grinned as Kazuko’s nervousness faded slightly.</p>
<p>It was far from perfect, but neither was their uncanny horror show. Neither wanted to sate the sugarcubes’ craving for something more savoury.</p>
<p>“Let’s do this.” she steeled herself as the cubes marched in, the jarring thud of their bodies rolling like dice across the surface of the labyrinth.</p>
<hr />
<p>As Kazuko swung the umbrella like a baseball bat, the inner structure crumpled in an instant. The girl let out a sympathetic whimper as the metallic tube sheared off at the handle. She made a gesture at Junko, grabby-hands grabbing her attention as she began working her way towards her peer.</p>
<p><em>Because I don’t have enought o deal with… </em></p>
<p>One cuboid lunged at her as though some oversized insect, saved only at the last minute with a twitch response. The accidental move left the would-be attacker skewered on her sabre, letting out a sharp whistling as it crumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>The unpunctured fist-sized chunks continued to dissolve, but she had bigger problems; her sword was bent, it was never intended for <em>real</em> combat anyways.</p>
<p>“Ah, fuck…” she let out sharply, ripping open the hardcase and shoving the blade inside.</p>
<p><em>If the sabre won’t do… Maybe the case will!</em></p>
<p>Kazuko let out a little yelp, kicking at the scuttling cubes as her assailants tore at her stockings. They clawed and gnawed, crystalline teeth eager to make work of something more tender.</p>
<p>She was <em>horrified</em>. She wouldn’t be for long; not of the cubes anyways.</p>
<p>Junko was covered in powdered sugar before not too long, panting heavily as the last lingering cube was reduced to a crumbly powder.</p>
<p>“Ha… ha!” she panted, her school blazer ripped with visible teethmarks. She was <em>exhausted</em>, barely managing to keep Kazuko safe. But she did it, and she was damned proud.</p>
