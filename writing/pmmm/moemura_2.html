<p>The lizard girl came to think of the goddess as pitiful.</p>
<p>And so, the lizard girl tore the goddess into two and she took one of those halves from heaven down to Earth with her.</p>
<hr />
<p>Homura had given up on braiding her hair. Sure, it was relaxing, sure, it was cute, but she had repeated her hair-flip fiasco in front of Sayaka as well, much to the same physiological cringing that she had done in front of Hitomi.</p>
<p>She thought she was having a <em>medical issue!</em></p>
<p>She refused to be reduced to such, such… stupidity! And so she removed the possibility.</p>
<p>“Oh wow Akemi-san looks entirely different with her hair down.”</p>
<p>“Reminds me of a librarian!”</p>
<p>“With those glasses? She’s so close to being <em>so</em> pretty! I wonder if she’d wear contacts.”</p>
<p><em>Jerks.</em></p>
<p>The barrage of compliments, unwarranted, unneeded, and entirely unexpected was mercifully cut short by presentations. The first was on a painting.</p>
<p>Homura wasn’t paying attention to <em>paintings</em> today.</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan?” she whispered, her voice barely audible above the details on what paints Mondrian liked to use.</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“Can I watch you warm up for <em>sports</em> after school?”</p>
<p>“<em>Huh?</em>”</p>
<p>Homura tilted her head, the shorthand their trio had inevitably arrived at for <del>shared psychosis</del> telepathy.</p>
<p><em>You say you’re a magical girl? Can you show me? I’m still a little doubtful that it wasn’t all a dream.</em></p>
<p><em>Homura-chan, we’re at school, I can’t just transform out in the open.</em></p>
<p><em>In the bathroom then. I’ll go with you.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka rolled her eyes, Hitomi only giggled.</p>
<p><em>Then the rumors get worse.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumors?</em></p>
<p>Hitomi’s giggle grew into a genuine smile.</p>
<p>“Homura-chan, I know you’re excited to watch <em>the game</em> eventually, but… don’t you think you’re being a little eager?”</p>
<p>Homura only returned her cordial smile with a fascimile of her shrewdness.</p>
<p>“Maybe. It just feels unreal that <em>Miki-san</em> is an <em>athlete</em>.”</p>
<p>Sayaka seethed in response. For all the annoyances their silly sports-based kayfabe had produced, Homura was entirely <em>right</em>. (She would never quite get used to, well, Homura being right.)</p>
<p>Homura had no reason to believe that magical girls were real except for a few strange oddities, and <em>maybe</em> Madoka’s chuunibyo speech. Why did Madoka have to go and alter her memories anyways? Had she truly abandoned all she held dear?</p>
<p><em>I’ll stay after school for a “club” if you will.</em></p>
<p>Mercifully, Kyouske’s arm remained healed in this <em>disaster</em> of a universe, so it wasn’t like she had to go and visit him in the hospital. Given that? Sayaka certainly didn’t have anything else going on.</p>
<p><em>Until then… do you have questions or somethin’?</em></p>
<p>Homura sat there, a veritable barrage accumulating in her psychic outbox.</p>
<p><em>So if you’re a magical girl, what do you fight? Or is it like a “defenders of the earth” thing? How many are you? Do you get special powers? How about a baton, or cute outfits? I kinda saw yours in the dream but maybe it’s different-</em></p>
<p><em>Whoa whoa whoa, calm down. This is a lot, Akemi-san. First off, I have a way more important question.</em></p>
<p><em>Go ahead.</em></p>
<p><em>Since when were you a nerd?</em></p>
<p>Homura tilted her head the other way, the confusion visible. Surely her hair being down wasn’t <em>that</em> dramatic a change as to think she was a different person, right?</p>
<p><em>Since… always?</em></p>
<p>“Huh…” Sayaka mumbled, scarcely aware she had let out sound.</p>
<p><em>At least she’s wearing the glasses still.</em></p>
<p><em>There are five, maybe six of us in Mitakihara. It’s a big city, so we gotta have enough girls to handle it. If we need extra firepower, we negotiate with the girls responsible for Kazamino or Kamihama.</em></p>
<p><em>Aren’t those on the other side of the country?</em></p>
<p><em>You gotta stop trying to poke holes in this. It’s magic, it isn’t always gonna make sense.</em></p>
<p>Homura shot Sayaka a dirty look, her patience clearly waning. She was studious, sure, but not patient. She had more than her fill of that in the hospital.</p>
<p><em>What do you fight then?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, mostly these things called wraiths.</em></p>
<p><em>Mostly?</em></p>
<p><em>Wraiths are made from the curses of humanity. Despair incarnate, the normal stuff. If you’ve read any shoujo manga ever, you know what to expect.</em></p>
<p><em>Really, you’re fighting evil by moonlight!?</em></p>
<p>Sayaka burst out laughing, Kazuko’s attention diverted from her classmate and her presentation on Mondrian’s “Gray Tree”, her frustration palpable.</p>
<p>“Miki-san, if you’d like to share what’s so <em>amusing</em>, I’m sure that Yuzuki-san would <em>love</em> to hear why you’re being so rude.”</p>
<p>A pink blur rose on the far side of the room, bowing immediately.</p>
<p>“Apologies Saotome-sensei. I had slipped Sayaka-chan a note saying that the tree reminded me of something crude and impolite. I accept all responsibility for her ouburst.”</p>
<p>Kazuko’s eyes darted between the two girls, as if weighing which would serve as a better martyr, her eyes finally settling on Madoka.</p>
<p>“This is very unlike you, Kaname-san. I’ll speak with you after class, but for now, sit down and don’t do it again.”</p>
<p>Kaname Madoka nodded hastily and descended into her seat, shooting daggers at Sayaka.</p>
<p><em>You will not be afforded another mercy. Behave yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>As you wish, o’ resplendent empress of the universe.</em></p>
<p>She knew <em>damn well</em> that her being a sarcastic brat carried perfectly on telepathy. Besides, you don’t become the perpetual right-hand of a goddess without getting <em>very</em> close to her.</p>
<p>Sayaka just prayed she wouldn’t get <em>too</em> upset given her recent rebel phase. She needed to stay alive long enough to fix this mess.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lunch arrived without much bravado. Yuzuki had continued her presentation, evoking imagery of the aftermath of nuclear fallout to juxtaspose Mondrian’s Gray Tree. She furthered the contrast against his other works, the art movement he was involved with, all approached with the dicipline of a rigorous academic.</p>
<p>Saotome-sensei apologized profusely for Sayaka-chan’s interruption, and ultimately gave her an A.</p>
<p><em>Shame they don’t know about his niece being a magical girl.</em></p>
<p>Madoka reflected on the mewlings of the countless familiars and witches whinging in her celestial ear. She permitted her inner circle (who said a god couldn’t have favorites?) to intercede on her beloved’s behalf, in leiu of more formalized leadership. She never did believe in hierarchical systems, but it was hard to describe the rules that made the universe as anything but.</p>
<p><em>And so, Saturn enabled her daughters, rending flesh from bone out of fear they too would attempt to overthrow her.</em></p>
<p>She turned a deaf ear to her obligations, and instead focused her attention on her beloved, her eternal, perpetual enemy.</p>
<p><em>It has to all be worth it. I have to save her.</em></p>
<p>Akemi Homura, her fallen angel, the one magical girl could not save because of the Incubator’s abuse of her beloved’s word.</p>
<p><em>Kyubey?</em></p>
<p>She felt the interloper materialize her shoulder, instinctually aware that the others in her class, magical girl or not, would be unable to see her least favorite tool.</p>
<p><em>Kaname Madoka.</em></p>
<p><em>See to it that Charlotte knows that her dues are coming up. She’ll recover in two cycles instead of five if she plays her role well.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you sure you wish to invoke Momoe Nagisa so quickly? This is still two days too early in the script we were provided.</em></p>
<p><em>You weren’t kept around to question my motives, Kyubey.</em></p>
<p>The Incubator hitched for a moment, as if attempting to retch up a furball, and then vanished with a message.</p>
<p><em>As you wish.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Homura fainted during gym class, stressed, collapsed. Sayaka leapt to her aid and somehow, against all odds, beat <em>Kaname-san</em> to her.</p>
<p>All the magic in the universe, and <em>Sayaka</em> got there first?</p>
<p>She shuddered, involuntarily. She didn’t like to show her dread, especially not in front of others, but the thought had simply <em>appeared</em> in her mind unbidden.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Madoka meant for me to get there first…</em></p>
<p>Sayaka hauled Homura onto the gurney in the nurse’s office, quickly checking her pulse as the nurse blinked in shock. She hadn’t seen them enter. (Sayaka wasn’t exactly moving <em>slowly</em>, after all)</p>
<p>As she jammed her fingers into Homura’s too-cold wrist, she couldn’t help but notice the silver band on her finger. Exactly the same as her.</p>
<p>Sakaya blinked. First Homura is in the dark about magical girls, then she has a damn <em>soul gem</em>? What kind of game was being played?</p>
<p><em>Homura?</em></p>
<p>Homura groaned, guttural and barely conscious, stars still dancing in her vision from her fainting spell.</p>
<p><em>You’re a magical girl!?</em></p>
<p>Homura blinked, slowly, scarcely able to look Sayaka in the eye.</p>
<p><em>What kind of magical girl collapses in a weak spring heat?</em></p>
<p><em>You apparently…</em></p>
<p>After what felt like an eternity, the nurse made her diagnosis, and they both breathed more easy for it.</p>
<p>“She was just dehydrated.” the nurse said rather flatly, still partially in disbelief at their inexplicable entrance.</p>
<p>“Have an electrolyte drink, then get back to classes when you’re not nauseous.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Homura murmured, her sentence aborted as the door chime to the office rang.</p>
<p>Pink hair, white ribbons. <em>Shit.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka didn’t want to deal with this, and here she was. Again. Unwittingly between a goddess and her devil, the world’s least stable throuple.</p>
<p>She so desperately wanted to hack-n’-slash her way out. She knew it’d do nothing, and so she didn’t. Barely.</p>
<p><em>Damn.</em></p>
<p>“Figures it’s you.” Sayaka muttered, Homura looking mortified.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you girls a minute.” the nurse murmured, exiting the nurses office in a hurry. The door closed in a clatter, leaving Kaname Madoka standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan.”</p>
<p>“Madoka.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re planning, but—”</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan, this isn’t part of some scheme. I can promise you that.”</p>
<p>Sayaka receded, visibly confused. This wasn’t like her…but then again, neither was stealing Homura’s whole “brooding embodiment of evil” visage.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to check up on my Homura-chan.”</p>
<p>“<em>Your</em> Homura-chan? Don’t you think you’ve <em>done enough?</em>”</p>
<p>Homura’s head was spinning still from nausea, the overhead lights too bright as she struggled to cover her eyes.</p>
<p>“Please… the lights…” she murmured.</p>
<p>Before Sayaka had a chance to react, Madoka was at the lightswitch, the room plunged into near darkness. The only illumination spare the light of the pulse-ox still resting on Homura’s finger was the luminescence of their souls, shining in the dark.</p>
<p><em>Thank you Sayaka-chan. I couldn’t get to her during gym in time because I was… I was busy.</em></p>
<p><em>Too busy stabbing innocents or something?</em></p>
<p><em>Sayaka-chan, please… Does this make you feel better? We want the same thing.</em></p>
<p><em>What I want? What I WANT is my best friend back.</em></p>
<p>Madoka looked at her, eyes weary. Sayaka knew. She knew what it was like to plunge yourself into hell for someone you love… but to throw away <em>heaven</em>? The infinite promises she made?</p>
<p><em>That’s… a lot harder Sayaka-chan. I’m not going to give up though, keeping hope is still my wish.</em></p>
<p>“Madoka…”</p>
<p>Homura reeled at the sound, lurching forward as glittering pink sand spilled out of her mouth onto the gurney.</p>
<p>“Whuh… the heth.” she mouthed, her tongue coated in the roseate grains.</p>
<p>Madoka froze, the source instantly obvious to her. She had watched the sand fall too many times as Homura reset time, frustratingly unable to stop it.</p>
<p>Within the context of her wish, Homura may as well have been a goddess from the moment she contracted. And now god was dying.</p>
<p>Her school attire dissolved in an instant, replaced with an ornate, black dress. A revealing plunge flattered her on an outfit that flowed down to her feet and stopped just short of strappy white heels. Her white ribbons became white bows, her nominally yellow, muted eyes replaced with incarnadine spheres, intimately familiar to Homura, even if she couldn’t place from where.</p>
<p>On her ear, rather than over her heart, shone a pink stone, wrapped in delicate petals. The gemstone hung suspended from the tail of a white bird of some kind, curled around the outside of the lobe. As if her attire hadn’t been extravagant enough, her hair seemed to braid itself into a single continuous bundle behind her back, many times longer and more luminous than it had been mere moments prior.</p>
<p>Homura knew instantaneously that Kaname Madoka <em>wasn’t</em> a magical girl. She was too <em>beautiful</em>, the woman unbecoming of the diminutive. And then she vomited glass.</p>
<hr />
<p>“You need to give her her memories back. Now.”</p>
<p>“I can’t! Not yet!”</p>
<p>“Some of them, Madoka. Please!”</p>
<p>“But if this goes wrong, it’ll do <em>worse</em> than kill her.”</p>
<p>“She’s vomiting <em>buckler fragments!</em> It’s already gone too far!”</p>
<p>Madoka winced. Sayaka was right. She may be a devil (and a pathetic one at that), but she wasn’t a monster. Madoka clapped her hands only once as the world shimmered.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Homura-chan.”</p>
<p>The ring on Homura’s finger shone brighter in the dim of the nurse’s office, Madoka loosening the now redundant ribbon from her hair, gently curling it up into Homura’s hands.</p>
<p>Sayaka gave up on all pretense of hiding what she was, summoning not only her magical girl attire, but healing tune circles, the runes obvious quarter and eighths notes with the benefit of her own self-awareness.</p>
<p><em>Ba, de, de, de, de, ba ba bi…</em></p>
<p><em>Sayaka-chan…</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry.</em></p>
<p>Her eyes still closed, a bloodstain still caught in the corner of her mouth, Homura managed to wrap the ribbon between her fingers, the faintest of violets trickling into the strands of fabric.</p>
<p><em>Her</em> magic.</p>
<p>Madoka took the cue to clap once more, the glow in the room returning to the muted, desperate grayscale that she hated so much, and took her leave. Still the villainess of the hour, she couldn’t be held accountable for a good deed, and so she left Sayaka with Homura. She was trusting her truest of loves to her strongest of friendships, even if both were at immense risk.</p>
<p><em>I hope you can forgive me, Homura-chan.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Homura awoke to find Sayaka Miki and… someone else, sitting in chairs at the edge of the room.</p>
<p>Immaculate blonde hair, flower pin, decently narrowing in who it could be. Hair in twin drills that could pierce the heavens? That made it plausibly one, maybe two people on the planet, and only one was an upperclassmen.</p>
<p>She had seen Sayaka murmuring to Hitomi when she had walked by the classroom previously, and the telepathic hearsay that continued long after she had departed.</p>
<p>“Tomoe…san?”</p>
<p>“That’s me.” she smiled, the same pacifying fascia that Hitomi erected. Her parents <em>had</em> been politicians, after all.</p>
<p>Some nacent part of Homura’s psyche realized in that moment that some of her memories had been returned, and more alarmingly, just how <em>much</em> of her past was missing.</p>
<p>She recalled ugly-crying on a train station platform, morning the late Sayaka. Sayaka Miki. The same girl sitting across from her, as if a concerned family member.</p>
<p><em>One mystery at a time.</em></p>
<p>“What happened to me, Miki-san?”</p>
<p>“You passed out on the field. Nurse said you were dehydrated.”</p>
<p>Homura turned her attention to Tomoe Mami, picking at the ends of her hair, a nervous tick gone awry.</p>
<p>“I… think that makes sense. But there was other talk in the nurses office… Something about the lights… I think?”</p>
<p>Sayaka awkwardly shuffled in her seat, not sure how to describe Kaname Madoka, <em>a lucifer unto herself</em>, to her most devout follower.</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Lady Kaname healed you.” Mami spoke confidently, with an ego commensurate with a high priestess.</p>
<p>Of <em>course</em> she would regard herself as such; pretender.</p>
<p>Sayaka leapt to her feet in an instant. “Oh fuck <em>off</em>, <em>I</em> healed her. All”Lady Kaname” did was help with the broken buckler.”</p>
<p>“Buckler? Healing? Huh?” Homura’s confusion twisting her face into knots, both Mami and Sayaka clearly upset by such neglect.</p>
<p>“A bucker is—”</p>
<p>“—a shield, but—”</p>
<p>“Smaller, and—”</p>
<p>“And I—”</p>
<p>Sayaka and Mami glared daggers back and forth, each interruption advancing the anger percolating to the surface. By the end of a singular sentence, costumes had materialized and old peers had ended up dangerously close to sparring. Homura’s attention was elsewhere though.</p>
<p>“Miki-san, your <em>outfit!</em>” Homura beamed, Sayaka suddenly feeling <em>incredibly</em> self-conscious of exposed midriff and a flattering top.</p>
<p>“A-and Tomoe-san, the BOOTS! They’re so, so, so… commanding!”</p>
<p>For a moment, Tomoe Mami returned to the nervous mentor both girls had known, her steeled demeanor slipping into a nervous blush.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you Akemi-san, that’s very sweet.”</p>
<p>“Jeez Homura, do you flirt with <em>every</em> girl you find out is a magical girl?”</p>
<p>Homura’s cheeks suddenly turned the same hue as the ribbon in her hand, realizing in that instant that she was <em>holding</em> such a thing.</p>
<p>Sayaka blinked once, twice, Tomoe Mami’s intonation appearing in her mind directly.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t that ribbon purple before?</em></p>
<p>Sayaka bit the inside of her cheek, nervous, thoughts scattered.</p>
<p><em>If she knows it’s the same ribbon, will she try to steal it back for Madoka?</em></p>
<p>She furroughed her brow, as if to give the illusion of thought.</p>
<p><em>I thought it was red?</em></p>
<p>“Hm.” Mami intoned, not sure she believed Sayaka’s response in whole, but confident enough to drop it for the time being.</p>
<p>For the time being.</p>
<p>Homura murmured, still very much bedridden as she reflected on the oddity in her hands, running the silken fabric through her fingers along the silver band. She shivered.</p>
<p>“Where did this ribbon come from?”</p>
<p>Neither girl opted to respond for a moment, the only sound the quiet hiss of the air circulating where they breathed.</p>
<p>“It was—”</p>
<p>“A gift! From our Lady Kaname.”</p>
<p>“Our?” Homura asked, clearly unsure what Tomoe-san was conveying in her declaration.</p>
<p>“Our Lady Kaname, whose mission is to banish despair? Who aspires to save magical girls from their inevitable fates the world over? To prevent more souls from being devoured by that <em>vile</em> Incubator?”</p>
<p>Homura simply blinked.</p>
<p>“What I think she <em>means to say</em> is that your”sworn enemy” left you a gift. I think she wants to be enemies-to-lovers, but it’s probably a little fast when you’re not even <em>enemies</em> yet.”</p>
<p>Homura looked down at the ribbon, holding it taught between her fingers.</p>
<p>“When I remember, we’ll be enemies…”</p>
<p><em>I don’t know if Tomoe-san is okay…</em> Homura thought to Sayaka, still fidgeting with the ribbon in her hands as iridescent sparkles flaked off of it.</p>
<p><em>She absolutely isn’t. Stop playing with it for now, please.</em></p>
<p>Homura swung her legs off the gurney, stars dancing in her eyes as she plunged the ribbon into the pocket of her school uniform.</p>
<p>“S-Sayaka-chan… I know I said we were going to do <em>sports stuff</em> toda—”</p>
<p>“You already’ve seen me in costume, Homura. I think we’re a little bit beyond asking to watch”warmups.”</p>
<p>Homura simply smiled.</p>
<p>“Then could I ask a <em>magical girl</em> to escort me safely home?”</p>
<p>Mami looked forlorn, as if considering breaking from her allegiances with such an innocent request.</p>
<p>“While I would love to, I have duties to attend to. The sun has set, and so wraiths are abound.”</p>
<p>“I got her, Mami-san. Don’t worry about us.”</p>
<p>“I won’t. The goddess watches over you.” she answered decisively, eyes closed as if in prayer. After a moment, Tomoe Mami dissolved her regalia, eyes cast down to the goldenrod gemstone that was her.</p>
<h2 id="with-a-sigh-she-exited-the-nurses-office-and-headed-for-home.">With a sigh, she exited the nurse’s office and headed for home.</h2>
<p>The pair of them walked out of the school building together, ersatz shadows cast up and sideways by spotlights installed by an architect. Allegedly.</p>
<p>The school had been going through construction as of late, the reason not entirely clear to Homura. She didn’t think it was especially important, so she just…. assumed it was part of the construction.</p>
<p>They exited the still-unlocked entrance gate to the school, turning and heading for the far side of town. Sayaka lead the way, Homura following as closely as she dared, but distinctly <em>not</em> holding her hand anymore.</p>
<p>A few blocks away from the school, Homura took the ribbon out of her pocket, running it through her fingers as if some rosary.</p>
<p>They crossed a plaza with a fountain, Homura realizing that if she was careful in how she knotted it, she could wear the ribbon in her hair. It’d even match her glasses.She gently pried her headband off, burying it into her schoolbag.</p>
<p>As they traversed the city more, the lighthouse rose out of the skyscrapers as the city fell away. By this point, they were clearly not heading in the direction of the Akemi household; neither seemed to much mind.</p>
<p>Leaning on a railing at the waterfront, Sayaka was pretty sure she could see Enkuboku twinkling across the sea. </p>
<p>Still blind to the actions of her peer, Homura had since tied the ribbon in her hair; a bow on her left side.</p>
<p><em>This feels more right.</em></p>
<p>“Homura-chan?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“You stopped stuttering…”</p>
<p>“I… yes. I suppose I did.”</p>
<p>Sayaka looked back at her, stopping head in her tracks. She just blinked.</p>
<p>“You put the ribbon on.”</p>
<p>“Should I not have?”</p>
<p>“No no, it’s good. It’s just…”</p>
<p>She shook her head, the thought dispersed with intentionality. She said nothing for a while, Homura’s attention seized by the glittering stone on her own finger.</p>
<p>“It suits you.” she declared, finally, her voice weak and pallid.</p>
<p>She felt as though her throat might burst. Stomach acid and shrapnel pouring out viciously. The simple ordeal of being consumed by one’s own body.</p>
<p>She let the sound of the ocean wash over her.</p>
<p>“Did you get your memories back?”</p>
<p>“I… some of them. I think.”</p>
<p>“What <em>do</em> you remember?”</p>
<p>Homura hemmed and hawed, uncharacteristic. She fixed her glasses, removing a single stray hair that had gotten pinched in the arm.</p>
<p>Anything but giving Sayaka a straight answer, looking back to find her expression distorted by concern. This was <em>not</em> a good look on her.</p>
<p>“I remember mourning you. You were <em>dead</em>, Sayaka-chan.”</p>
<p>“And… what happens when a magical girl dies?”</p>
<p>“You’re going to ignore that I said you’re supposed to be <em>dead</em>?”</p>
<p>“No. There’s a more important question though. Answer it.”</p>
<p>“She turns into…. something. Something bad, despair. A wraith?”</p>
<p>Sayaka looked at her, desperation in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Homura… Magical girls turn into <em>witches</em>.”</p>
