<h3 id="circularization">Circularization</h3>
<p>The lizard girl came to think of the goddess as pitiful.</p>
<p>And so, the lizard girl tore the goddess into two and she took one of those halves from heaven down to Earth with her.</p>
<hr />
<p>Homura had given up on braiding her hair. Sure, it was relaxing, sure, it was cute, but she had repeated her hair-flip fiasco in front of Sayaka as well, much to the same physiological cringing that she had done in front of Hitomi.</p>
<p>She thought she was having a <em>medical issue!</em></p>
<p>She refused to be reduced to such, such… stupidity! And so she removed the possibility.</p>
<p>“Oh wow Akemi-san looks entirely different with her hair down.”</p>
<p>“Reminds me of a librarian!”</p>
<p>“With those glasses? She’s so close to being <em>so</em> pretty! I wonder if she’d wear contacts.”</p>
<p><em>Jerks.</em></p>
<p>The barrage of compliments, unwarranted, unneeded, and entirely unexpected was mercifully cut short by presentations. The first was on a painting.</p>
<p>Homura wasn’t paying attention to <em>paintings</em> today.</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan?” she whispered, her voice barely audible above the details on what paints Mondrian liked to use.</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“Can I watch you warm up for <em>sports</em> after school?”</p>
<p>“<em>Huh?</em>”</p>
<p>Homura tilted her head, the shorthand their trio had inevitably arrived at for <del>psychosis</del> telepathy.</p>
<p><em>You say you’re a magical girl? Can you show me? I’m still a little doubtful that it wasn’t all a dream.</em></p>
<p><em>Homura-chan, we’re at school, I can’t just transform out in the open.</em></p>
<p><em>In the bathroom then. I’ll go with you.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka rolled her eyes, Hitomi only giggled.</p>
<p><em>Then the rumors get worse.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumors?</em></p>
<p>Hitomi’s giggle grew into a genuine smile.</p>
<p>“Homura-chan, I know you’re excited to watch <em>the game</em> eventually, but… don’t you think you’re being a little eager?”</p>
<p>Homura only returned her cordial smile with a fascimile of her shrewdness.</p>
<p>“Maybe. It just feels unreal that <em>Miki-san</em> is an <em>athlete</em>.”</p>
<p>Sayaka seethed in response. For all the annoyances their silly sports-based kayfabe had produced, Homura was entirely <em>right</em>. (She would never get used to that, no matter how much she owed to to Homura to change her mind)</p>
<p>Homura had no reason to believe that magical girls were real except for a few strange oddities, and <em>maybe</em> Madoka’s chuunibyo speech. Why did Madoka have to go and alter her memories anyways? Had she truly abandoned all she held dear?</p>
<p><em>Fine. I’ll stay after school for a “club” if you will.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka reflected to herself. Mercifully, Kyouske’s arm remained healed in this <em>disaster</em> of a universe. She didn’t have anything else going on.</p>
<p><em>Until then… do you have questions or somethin’?</em></p>
<p>Homura sat there, a veritable barrage accumulating in her psychic outbox.</p>
<p><em>So if you’re a magical girl, what do you fight? Or is it like a “defenders of the earth” thing? How many are you? Do you get special powers? How about a baton, or cute outfits? I kinda saw yours in the dream but maybe it’s different-</em></p>
<p><em>Whoa whoa whoa, calm down. This is a lot, Akemi-san. First off, I have a way more important question.</em></p>
<p><em>Go ahead.</em></p>
<p><em>Since when were you a nerd?</em></p>
<p>Homura tilted her head, the confusion visible. Surely her hair being down wasn’t <em>that</em> dramatic a change as to think she was a different person, right?</p>
<p><em>Since… always?</em></p>
<p>“Huh…” Sayaka mumbled, scarcely aware she had let out sound.</p>
<p><em>There are maybe five, six of us in Mitakihara. It’s a big city, so we gotta have a team capable of handling it. If we need extra firepower, we negotiate with the girls responsible for Kazamino or Kamihama.</em></p>
<p><em>Aren’t those on the other side of the country?</em></p>
<p><em>You gotta stop trying to poke holes in this. It’s magic, it isn’t always gonna make sense.</em></p>
<p>Homura shot Sayaka a dirty look, her patience clearly waning. She was studious, sure, but not patient. She had more than her fill of that in the hospital.</p>
<p><em>What do you fight then?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, mostly these things called wraiths.</em></p>
<p><em>Mostly?</em></p>
<p><em>Wraiths are made from the curses of humanity. Despair incarnate, the normal stuff. If you’ve read any shoujo manga ever, you know what to expect.</em></p>
<p><em>Really, you’re fighting evil by moonlight!?</em></p>
<p>Sayaka burst out laughing, Kazuko’s attention diverted from her classmate and her presentation on Mondrian’s “Gray Tree”.</p>
<p>“Miki-san, if you’d like to share what’s so <em>amusing</em>, I’m sure that Yuzuki-san would <em>love</em> to hear why you’re being so rude.”</p>
<p>A pink blur rose on the far side of the room, bowing immediately.</p>
<p>“Apologies Saotome-sensei. I had slipped Sayaka-chan a note saying that the tree reminded me of something crude and impolite. I accept all responsibility for her ouburst.”</p>
<p>Kazuko’s eyes darted between the two girls, her eyes finally settling on Madoka.</p>
<p>“This is very unlike you, Kaname-san. I’ll speak with you after class, but for now, sit down and don’t do it again.”</p>
<p>She nodded hastily and descended into her seat, shooting daggers at Sayaka.</p>
<p><em>You will not be afforded another mercy. Behave yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>As you wish, o’ resplendent empress of the universe.</em></p>
<p>She knew <em>damn well</em> Madoka would know she was being a sarcastic brat. You don’t become the eternal right-hand of a goddess without getting <em>very</em> close to her.</p>
<p>She just prayed she wouldn’t get too upset given her recent rebel phase. She needed to stay alive long enough to fix this mess.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lunch arrived without much bravado. Yuzuki had continued her presentation, evoking imagery of the aftermath of nuclear fallout to juxtaspose Mondrian’s Gray Tree. She furthered the contrast against his other works, the art movement he was involved with, all approached with the dicipline of a rigorous academic.</p>
<p>Saotome-sensei apologized profusely for Sayaka-chan’s interruption, and ultimately gave her an A.</p>
<p><em>Shame they don’t know about his niece being a magical girl.</em></p>
<p>Madoka reflected on the mewlings of the countless familiars and witches whinging in her celestial ear. She permitted her inner circle (who said a god couldn’t have favorites?) to intercede on her beloved’s behalf, in leiu of more formalized leadership. She never did believe in hierarchical systems, but it was hard to describe the rules that made the universe as anything but.</p>
<p><em>And so, Saturn enabled her daughters, rending flesh from bone out of fear they too would attempt to overthrow her.</em></p>
<p>She turned a deaf ear to her obligations, and instead focused her attention on her beloved, her eternal, perpetual enemy.</p>
<p><em>It has to all be worth it. I have to save her.</em></p>
<p>Akemi Homura, her fallen angel, the one magical girl could not save because of the Incubator’s abuse of her beloved’s word.</p>
<p><em>Kyubey?</em></p>
<p>She felt the interloper materialize her shoulder, instinctually aware that the others in her class, magical girl or not, would be unable to see her least favorite tool.</p>
<p><em>Kaname Madoka.</em></p>
<p><em>See to it that Charlotte knows that her dues are coming up. She’ll recover in two cycles instead of five if she plays her role well.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you sure you wish to invoke Momoe Nagisa so quickly? This is still two days too early in the script we were provided.</em></p>
<p><em>You weren’t kept around to question my motives, Kyubey.</em></p>
<p>The Incubator hitched for a moment, as if attempting to retch up a furball, and then vanished with a message.</p>
<p><em>As you wish.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Homura got to see Sayaka’s costume. She had fainted during gym class, and Sayaka beat <em>Kaname-san</em> to her. Impressive, all things considered. All the magic in the universe, and <em>Sayaka</em> got there first?</p>
<p>She shuddered, involuntarily. She didn’t like to show her dread, especially not in front of others, but the thought had simply <em>appeared</em>.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Madoka meant for me to get there first…</em></p>
<p>Sayaka hauled Homura onto the gurney in the nurse’s office, quickly checking her pulse.</p>
<p>As she jammed her fingers into Homura’s too-cold wrist, she couldn’t help but notice the silver band on her finger. Exactly the same as her.</p>
<p>Sakaya blinked. First she knows nothing about magical girls, but then she <em>has a soul gem</em>? What kind of game was being played?</p>
<p><em>Homura?</em></p>
<p>Homura groaned, guttural and barely conscious, stars still dancing in her vision from her fainting spell.</p>
<p><em>You’re a magical girl too you know.</em></p>
<p><em>What kind of magical girl collapses in a spring heat?</em></p>
<p><em>You apparently…</em></p>
<p>After what felt like an eternity, the nurse made her diagnosis, and they both breathed more easy for it.</p>
<p>“She was just dehydrated.” the nurse said rather flatly. “Have an electrolyte drink, then get back to classes when you’re not nauseous.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Homura murmured, as the bell to the office rang. Pink hair, white ribbons. <em>Shit.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka didn’t want to deal with this, and here she was. Again. Unwittingly between a goddess and her devil, the world’s least stable throuple.</p>
<p>She so desperately wanted to hack-n’-slash her way out. She knew it’d do nothing, so she didn’t.</p>
<p><em>Damn.</em></p>
<p>“Figures it was you.” Sayaka muttered, Homura looking mortified.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you girls a minute.” the nurse murmured, leaving Kaname Madoka standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan.”</p>
<p>“Madoka.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re planning, but-”</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan… this isn’t part of some scheme. I can promise you that.”</p>
<p>Sayaka receded, visibly confused. This wasn’t like her… you don’t force your other half to take your place in heaven and then <em>let her get sick</em>.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to check up on my Homura-chan.”</p>
<p>“<em>Your</em> Homura-chan? Don’t you think you’ve <em>done enough?</em>”</p>
<p>Homura’s head was spinning still from nausea, the overhead lights too bright as she struggled to cover her eyes.</p>
<p>“Please… the lights…” she murmured.</p>
<p>In an instant, Madoka was at the lightswitch, the room plunged into near darkness, spare the light of the pulse-ox still resting on Homura’s finger, and the faintest of glowing their souls in the dark. </p>
<p><em>Thank you Sayaka-chan. I couldn’t get to her during gym in time because I was… I was busy.</em></p>
<p><em>Too busy stabbing innocents or something?</em></p>
<p><em>Sayaka-chan, please… Does this make you feel better? We want the same thing.</em></p>
<p><em>What I want? What I WANT is my best friend back.</em></p>
<p>Madoka looked at her, eyes weary. Sayaka knew. She knew what it was like to plunge yourself into hell for someone you love… but to throw away <em>heaven</em>? The infinite promises she made?</p>
<p><em>That’s… a lot harder Sayaka-chan. I’m not going to give up though, keeping hope is still my wish.</em></p>
<p><em>Madoka…</em></p>
<p>Homura reeled at the sound, lurching forward as glittering pink sand spilled out of her mouth onto the gurney.</p>
<p>“Whuh… the heth.” she mouthed, her tongue coated in the roseate grains.</p>
<p>Madoka froze, the source instantly obvious to her. She had watched the sand fall too many times as Homura reset time, frustratingly unable to stop it.</p>
<p>Within the context of her wish, Homura may as well have been a goddess from the moment she contracted.</p>
<p>Her school attire dissolving in an instant, replaced with an ornate, black dress, a revealing plunge on an outfit that flowed down to her feet and stopped just short of strappy white heels. Her white ribbons became white bows, her nominally yellow, muted eyes replaced with incarnadine spheres, intimately familiar to Homura, even if she couldn’t place from where.</p>
<p>On her ear, rather than over her heart, shone a pink stone, wrapped in delicate petals. The gemstone hung suspended from the tail of a white bird of some kind. As if her attire hadn’t been enough, her hair seemed to braid itself into a single continuous bundle behind her back, many times longer and more luminous than it had been mere moments prior.</p>
<p>Homura knew instantaneously that Kaname Madoka wasn’t a magical girl, somehow. She was too <em>beautiful</em>. And then she vomited glass.</p>
<p>“You need to give her her memories back. Now.”</p>
<p>“But if this goes wrong, it could do <em>worse</em> than kill her.”</p>
<p>“If she’s vomiting <em>buckler fragments!?</em> It’s already gone too far!”</p>
<p>Madoka winced. Sayaka was right. She may be a devil (and a pathetic one at that), but she wasn’t a monster. She clapped her hands only once as the world shimmered.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Homura-chan.”</p>
<p>The ring on Homura’s finger shining brighter in the dim of the nurse’s office, and Madoka untied one of her ribbons, placing it into Homura’s hands.</p>
<p>Sayaka gave up on all pretense of hiding what she was, summoning not only her magical girl attire, but healing tune circles, the runes obvious quarter and eighths notes with the benefit of her own self-awareness.</p>
<p><em>Ba, de, de de, ba ba…</em> </p>
<p><em>Sayaka-chan…</em></p>
<p><em>Sorry.</em></p>
<p>Her eyes still closed, a bloodstain still caught in the corner of her mouth, Homura managed to wrap the ribbon between her fingers, the faintest of violets trickling into the strands of fabric.</p>
<p><em>Her</em> magic.</p>
<p>Madoka took the cue to clap once more, the glow in the room returning to the muted, desperate grayscale that she hated so much, and took her leave. Still the villainess of the hour, she couldn’t be held accountable for a good deed, and so she left Sayaka with Homura. She was trusting her truest of loves to her strongest of friendships, even if both were at immense risk.</p>
<p><em>I hope you can forgive me, Homura-chan.</em></p>
