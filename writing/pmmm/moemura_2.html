<h3 id="circularization">Circularization</h3>
<p>The lizard girl came to think of the goddess as pitiful.</p>
<p>And so, the lizard girl tore the goddess into two and she took one of those halves from heaven down to Earth with her.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Sayaka-chan?”</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Can I see you warm up for sports?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p><em>You say you’re a magical girl? Prove it.</em></p>
<p><em>Homura-chan, we’re at school, I can’t just transform here.</em></p>
<p><em>In the bathroom. I’ll go with you.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka rolled her eyes, Hitomi only giggled.</p>
<p><em>Then the rumors get worse.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumors?</em></p>
<p>Hitomi’s giggle grew into a genuine smile.</p>
<p>“Homura-chan, I know you’re excited to watch <em>the game</em> eventually, but… don’t you think you’re being a little eager?”</p>
<p>Homura only returned her cordial smile with a fascimile of her shrewdness.</p>
<p>“Shizuki-san, surely you can understand why it feels like just a rumor as-is. Until I see her in <em>uniform</em>, it’s easy to believe she’s just a scrawny student and not an <em>athlete</em>.”</p>
<p>Sayaka seethed in response. Homura was <em>right</em>, she had no reason to believe her since her memories had been altered. Why did Madoka have to go and do what she did to her? Had she truly lost her mind?</p>
<p>Homura sat there, mind reeling.</p>
<p><em>So if you’re a magical girl, what do you fight? Or is it like a “defenders of the earth” thing? How many are you? Do you get special powers? How about a baton, or cute outfits? I kinda saw yours in the dream but maybe it’s different-</em></p>
<p><em>Whoa whoa whoa, calm down. This is a lot, Akemi-san. First off, I have a way more important question.</em></p>
<p><em>Go ahead.</em></p>
<p><em>Since when were you a nerd?</em></p>
<p>Homura tilted her head, the tail of her braid bobbing gently in response. The beads collided with the back of her chair, the clatter audible. <em>Since… always?</em></p>
<p>“Huh…” Sayaka mumbled, scarcely aware she had let out sound.</p>
<p><em>There are maybe five, six of us in Mitakihara. It’s a big city, so we gotta have a team capable of handling it. If we need extra firepower, we negotiate with the girls responsible for Kazamino or Kamihama.</em></p>
<p><em>Aren’t those on the other side of the country?</em></p>
<p><em>You gotta stop trying to poke holes in this. It’s magic, it isn’t always gonna make sense.</em></p>
<p>Homura shot Sayaka a dirty look, her patience clearly waning. She was studious, sure, but not patient. She had more than her fill of that in the hospital.</p>
<p><em>What do you fight then?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, mostly these things called wraiths.</em></p>
<p><em>Mostly?</em></p>
<p><em>Wraiths are made from the curses of humanity. Despair incarnate, the normal stuff. If you’ve read any shoujo manga ever, you know what to expect.</em></p>
<p><em>Really, you’re fighting evil by moonlight!?</em></p>
<p>Sayaka burst out laughing, Kazuko’s attention diverted from her classmate and her presentation on Mondrian’s “Gray Tree”.</p>
<p>“Miki-san, if you’d like to share what’s so <em>amusing</em>, I’m sure that Yuzuki-san would <em>love</em> to hear why you’re being so rude.”</p>
<p>A pink blur rose on the far side of the room, bowing immediately.</p>
<p>“Apologies Saotome-sensei. I had slipped Sayaka-chan a note saying that the tree reminded me of something crude and impolite. I accept all responsibility for her ouburst.”</p>
<p>Kazuko’s eyes darted between the two girls, her eyes finally settling on Madoka.</p>
<p>“This is very unlike you, Kaname-san. I’ll speak with you after class, but for now, sit down and don’t do it again.”</p>
<p>She nodded hastily and descended into her seat, shooting daggers at Sayaka.</p>
<p><em>You will not be afforded another mercy. Behave yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>As you wish, my resplendent empress of the universe.</em></p>
<p>She knew <em>damn well</em> Madoka would get the sarcasm, telepathy or not. You don’t become the eternal right-hand of a Law of the Universe without getting <em>very</em> close to someone.</p>
<p>She just prayed she wouldn’t get too upset with it. She needed to stay alive long enough to fix this mess.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lunch arrived without much bravado. Yuzuki had continued her presentation, evoking imagery of the aftermath of nuclear fallout to juxtaspose Mondrian’s Gray Tree. She furthered the contrast against his other works, the art movement he was involved with, all approached with the dicipline of a studious academic.</p>
<p>Saotome-sensei apologized profusely for Sayaka-chan’s interruption, and ultimately gave her a B.</p>
<p><em>Shame they don’t know about his niece being a magical girl.</em></p>
<p>Madoka reflected on the mewlings of the countless familiars and witches whinging in her celestial ear. She permitted her inner circle (who said a god couldn’t have favorites?) to devour the others, their grief seeds bursting back to life quickly.</p>
<p><em>And so, Saturn enabled her daughters, rending flesh from bone out of fear they too would attempt to overthrow her.</em></p>
<p>She turned a deaf ear to her obligations, and instead focused her attention on her beloved, her eternal, perpetual enemy.</p>
<p><em>It has to all be worth it. I have to save her.</em></p>
<p>Akemi Homura, her fallen angel, the one magical girl could not save because of the Incubator’s abuse of her beloved’s word.</p>
<p><em>Kyubey?</em></p>
<p>She felt the interloper materialize her shoulder, instinctually aware that the others in her class, magical girl or not, would be unable to see her most useful tool at the moment.</p>
<p><em>Kaname Madoka.</em></p>
<p><em>See to it that Charlotte knows that her dues are coming up. She’ll recover in two cycles instead of five if she plays her role well.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you sure you wish to invoke Momoe Nagisa so quickly? This is still two days too early in the script we were provided.</em></p>
<p><em>You weren’t kept around to question my motives, Kyubey.</em></p>
<p>The Incubator hitched for a moment, as if attempting to retch up a furball, and then vanished with a message.</p>
<p><em>As you wish.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Homura got to see Sayaka’s costume. She had fainted during gym class, and Sayaka beat Kaname-san to her. Impressive, all things considered. All the magic in the universe, and <em>Sayaka</em> got there first?</p>
<p>She shuddered, involuntarily. She didn’t like to show her fear, especially not in front of others, but the thought had simply <em>appeared</em>.</p>
<p><em>Maybe she meant for me to…</em></p>
<p>Somewhere, deep inside her soul gem, someone <em>else</em> agreed.</p>
<p>Sayaka hauled Homura onto the gurney in the nurse’s office, quickly checking her pulse.</p>
<p>As she jammed her fingers into Homura’s too-cold wrist, she couldn’t help but notice the silver band on her finger. Exactly the same as her.</p>
<p>Sakaya blinked. First she knows nothing about magical girls, but then she <em>has a soul gem</em>? What kind of game was being played?</p>
<p><em>Homura?</em></p>
<p>Homura groaned, guttural and barely conscious, stars still dancing in her vision from her fainting spell.</p>
<p><em>You’re a magical girl too you know.</em></p>
<p><em>What kind of magical girl collapses in a spring heat?</em></p>
<p><em>You apparently…</em></p>
<p>After what felt like an eternity, the nurse made her diagnosis, and they both breathed more easy for it.</p>
<p>“She was just dehydrated.” the nurse said, as the doorbell to the office rang. Pink hair, white ribbons. <em>Shit.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka didn’t want to deal with this, and here she was. Again. Unwittingly between a goddess and her devil, the world’s least stable throuple.</p>
<p>She so desperately wanted to hack-n’-slash her way out. She knew it’d do nothing, so she didn’t.</p>
<p><em>Damn.</em></p>
<p>“Figures it was you.” Sayaka muttered, Homura looking mortified.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you girls a minute.” the nurse murmured, leaving Kaname Madoka standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan.”</p>
<p>“Madoka.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re planning, but-”</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan… this isn’t part of some scheme. I can promise you that.”</p>
<p>Sayaka receded, visibly confused. This wasn’t like her… you don’t force your other half to take your place in heaven and then <em>let her get sick</em>.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to check up on my Homura-chan.”</p>
<p>“<em>Your</em> Homura-chan? Don’t you think you’ve <em>done enough?</em>”</p>
<p>Homura’s head was spinning still from nausea, the overhead lights too bright as she struggled to cover her eyes.</p>
<p>“Please… the lights…” she murmured.</p>
<p>In an instant, Madoka was at the lightswitch, the room plunged into near darkness, spare the light of the pulse-ox still resting on Homura’s finger, and the faintest of glowing their souls resting on their fingers.</p>
<p><em>Sayaka…. I couldn’t get to her during gym because I was… I was occupied.</em></p>
<p><em>Too busy stabbing innocents or something?</em></p>
<p><em>Please stop mouthing off… it does neither of us any good. We want the same thing.</em></p>
<p><em>I want my best friend back.</em></p>
<p>Madoka looked at her, eyes weary. Sayaka knew. She knew what it was like to plunge yourself into hell for someone you love… but to throw away <em>heaven</em>? The infinite promises she made?</p>
<p><em>That… is a lot harder Sayaka-chan. Maybe we don’t want the same thing after all.</em></p>
<p><em>Madoka…</em></p>
<p>Homura reeled at the sound, lurching forward as glittering pink sand spilled out of her mouth onto the gurney.</p>
<p>“Whuh… the heth.” she mouthed, her tongue coated in the glittery substance.</p>
<p>Madoka froze, her school attire dissolving in an instant, replaced with an ornate, black dress, a revealing plunge on an outfit that flowed down to her feet and stopped just short of strappy white heels. Her white ribbons became white bows, her nominally yellow, muted eyes replaced with incarnadine spheres, intimately familiar to Homura, even if she couldn’t place from where. On her ear, rather than over her heart, shone a pink stone, wrapped in delicate petals. The gemstone hung suspended from the tail of a white bird of some kind. As if her attire hadn’t been enough, her hair seemed to braid itself into a single continuous bundle behind her back, many times longer and more luminous than it had been mere moments prior.</p>
<p>Homura knew instantaneously that Kaname Madoka was something else entirely. And then she vomited <em>higanbana.</em></p>
<p>“You <em>need</em> to give her her memories back. Now.*</p>
<p><em>But if this goes wrong, it could do worse than kill her.</em></p>
<p><em>If she’s vomiting </em>spiderlilies* it’s already gone too far!*</p>
<p>Madoka winced, and clapped her hands.</p>
<p>The pile of pink sand vanished from the gurney, and the rign on Homura’s finger shone brighter in the dark.</p>
<p>“Madoka…”</p>
<p>“Homura….”</p>
<p>“Homura-chan… where’s your buckler. This isn’t a joke, you need to transform-”</p>
<p>“Transform, but-”</p>
<p>Sayaka stood at attention, her outfit already having been replaced with gold-trimmed armor pieces, the gemstone in her navel glittering radiantly.</p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan, please. Put aside how you feel about me, can you heal her?”</p>
<p>“I can’t her if I don’t know what’s <em>wrong</em>!”</p>
<hr />
<p>Homura was panting, footfall clattering against the monochromatic landscape as she raced through the distorted realm.</p>
<p>She had tripped into something strange, something <em>gross</em>, and it was horrifying.</p>
<p>“Homura!” Sayaka bellowed as she barreled into the arch, her sword dislodging brick by brick as the witch groaned in agony.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…” Sayaka whispered, screaming down to Homura.</p>
<p>“You okay!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“What the hell <em>is that thing!</em>”</p>
<p>“A witch!”</p>
<p>“What’s a witch! I thought you fought wraiths!?”</p>
<p>Musketfire exploded next to Homura’s ear.</p>
<p>“We do.”</p>
<p>“Who are <em>you</em>?” Homura balked, the new girl vaguely familiar, but clearly another magical girl. Curly locks in a vibrant yellow, not-quite-blonde, a feathered beret-cap, a glittering yellow gem nestled at the center of a flower. She was holding a musket in the same decor (aren’t guns illegal!?)</p>
<p>“Tomoe Mami. I’m a friend.”</p>
<p>“Of Sayaka-chan?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>Homura wasn’t sure, but she found herself thinking about that strange dream; is this that same girl?</p>
<p>On her shoulder was perched none other than the cabbity interloper themself.</p>
<p>“Uh…” Homura muttered, jaw agape. Sure, she was still in a nightmarish labyrinth, but the creature on the new girl, Tomoe-san, was it? On her shoulder, it was like someone had animated an amalgamation of every shoujo animal into one. Golden rings, long ear….hands? It all blurred.</p>
<p><em>Hello, Akemi Homura.</em></p>
<p>“It can speak.”</p>
<p><em>Yes. Akemi Homura, are you aware you are an irregularity?</em></p>
<p>“Kyubey, we don’t have time for this.”</p>
<p>“You and Sayaka Miki do not have time”for this”, Tomoe Mami. I must talk to Akemi Homura. Please dispatch the witch.”</p>
<p>Mami-san shot Kyubey a dirty look as the furball leapt off of Mami’s shoulder and landed squarely around Homura’s neck.</p>
<p><em>He smells like disinfectant… kinda.</em></p>
<p>“Hey there little guy…” Homura murmured, scratching the creature under the chin, a purple and black diamond barely visible on her fingernail.</p>
<p>Sayaka looked down at Tomoe Mami and registered that she was wearing a look of disgust, her arms holding her musket close, as if to stop herself from using it. She wasn’t staring at Sayaka, no. She was looking at <em>Kyubey</em>.</p>
<p><em>Huh.</em></p>
