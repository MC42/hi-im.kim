<p>“Sayaka-chan?”</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Can I see you warm up for sports?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p><em>You say you’re a magical girl? Prove it.</em></p>
<p><em>Homura-chan, we’re at school, I can’t just transform here.</em></p>
<p><em>In the bathroom. I’ll go with you.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka rolled her eyes, Hitomi only giggled.</p>
<p><em>Then the rumors get worse.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumors?</em></p>
<p>Hitomi’s giggle grew into a genuine smile.</p>
<p>“Homura-chan, I know you’re excited to watch <em>the game</em> eventually, but… don’t you think you’re being a little eager?”</p>
<p>Homura only returned her cordial smile with a fascimile of her shrewdness.</p>
<p>“Shizuki-san, surely you can understand why it feels like just a rumor as-is. Until I see her in <em>uniform</em>, it’s easy to believe she’s just a scrawny student and not an <em>athlete</em>.”</p>
<p>Sayaka seethed in response. Homura was <em>right</em>, she had no reason to believe her since her memories had been altered. Why did Madoka have to go and do what she did to her? Had she truly lost her mind?</p>
<p>Homura sat there, mind reeling.</p>
<p><em>So if you’re a magical girl, what do you fight? Or is it like a “defenders of the earth” thing? How many are you? Do you get special powers? How about a baton, or cute outfits? I kinda saw yours in the dream but maybe it’s different-</em></p>
<p><em>Whoa whoa whoa, calm down. This is a lot, Akemi-san. First off, I have a way more important question.</em></p>
<p><em>Go ahead.</em></p>
<p><em>Since when were you a nerd?</em></p>
<p>Homura tilted her head, the tail of her braid bobbing gently in response. The beads collided with the back of her chair, the clatter audible. <em>Since… always?</em></p>
<p>“Huh…” Sayaka mumbled, scarcely aware she had let out sound.</p>
<p><em>There are maybe five, six of us in Mitakihara. It’s a big city, so we gotta have a team capable of handling it. If we need extra firepower, we negotiate with the girls responsible for Kazamino or Kamihama.</em></p>
<p><em>Aren’t those on the other side of the country?</em></p>
<p><em>You gotta stop trying to poke holes in this. It’s magic, it isn’t always gonna make sense.</em></p>
<p>Homura shot Sayaka a dirty look, her patience clearly waning. She was studious, sure, but not patient. She had more than her fill of that in the hospital.</p>
<p><em>What do you fight then?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, mostly these things called wraiths.</em></p>
<p><em>Mostly?</em></p>
<p><em>Wraiths are made from the curses of humanity. Despair incarnate, the normal stuff. If you’ve read any shoujo manga ever, you know what to expect.</em></p>
<p><em>Really, you’re fighting evil by moonlight!?</em></p>
<p>Sayaka burst out laughing, Kazuko’s attention diverted from her classmate and her presentation on Mondrian’s “Gray Tree”.</p>
<p>“Miki-san, if you’d like to share what’s so <em>amusing</em>, I’m sure that Yuzuki-san would <em>love</em> to hear why you’re being so rude.”</p>
<p>A pink blur rose on the far side of the room, bowing immediately.</p>
<p>“Apologies Saotome-sensei. I had slipped Sayaka-chan a note saying that the tree reminded me of something crude and impolite. I accept all responsibility for her ouburst.”</p>
<p>Kazuko’s eyes darted between the two girls, her eyes finally settling on Madoka.</p>
<p>“This is very unlike you, Kaname-san. I’ll speak with you after class, but for now, sit down and don’t do it again.”</p>
<p>She nodded hastily and descended into her seat, shooting daggers at Sayaka.</p>
<p><em>You will not be afforded another mercy. Behave yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>As you wish, my resplendent empress of the universe.</em></p>
<p>She knew <em>damn well</em> Madoka would get the sarcasm, telepathy or not. You don’t become the eternal right-hand of a Law of the Universe without getting <em>very</em> close to someone.</p>
<p>She just prayed she wouldn’t get too upset with it. She needed to stay alive long enough to fix this mess.</p>
