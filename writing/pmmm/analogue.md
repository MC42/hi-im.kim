## Act 1 - Urban Decay

<!-- 1993 Okushiri earthquake https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Okushiri_earthquake?useskin=vector -->
Kaname Junko <!-- The characters in her first name mean "詢" (to consult with) and "子" (child) respectively.--> *hated* the pouring rain, huddling in the bus stop as she prayed for the next bus to arrive on time.  The area around school was under construction as of late, and despite best efforts, their escapes home tended to be unpredictable at the best of times.

"It'll either arrive in eight minutes, fifteen, or not at all."

Junko scowled back at Kazuko Saotome, <!-- The characters in her last name mean "早" (quickly), "乙" (secondary), and "女" (woman) respectively.
    The characters in her first name mean "和" (harmony) and "子" (child) respectively. --> ever the persistent bookworm she was.  She had memorized most of the timetable through force of habit, and sheer force of will.  Junko couldn't help but admire her a little for it.

"Hmph."

"Next time when I *tell you* to pack an umbrella, actually *get one* please?"

"How was *I* supposed to know a little rain turned into a typhoon!" she yelped, gesturing wildly at the torrent outside of their meager bus shelter.

"Same way as everyone else... listen to the weather report!  Or ask your parents, I don't know!"

Junko remained silent, sulking quietly as she digested just how *right* she was and how *little* she wanted to admit it.  This back and fourth was emblematic of their friendship, she thought, many assuming the bookish girl to be intelligent and reserved; she was nothing of the sort in the right company.

And so on their worst days their tempers got the best of them, leading to many a screaming match assuaged by shitty ramen <!-- . o O ( City uncooked-ramen scene but with Junko ) --> and snacks they brought to school that they definitely shouldn't have had.

Junko *conveniently* forgot to tell her family that the principal <!-- ? --> had called her a delinquent, and Kazuko *conveniently* went home with some reading materials that a girl of her upbringing probably wouldn't have otherwise.  Her parents didn't want her reading anything "indecent", and so she "didn't".

They both cherished their friendship, even if they did still butt heads about boys.

"So, how was fencing?"

"Same as usual.  Kicked some ass." she grinned wildly, Kazuko rolling her eyes at the bravado.

"And that means *losing* half your matches?"

"I went 5-3 today!  Take it back or I'll add *you* to my list of defeats!"

A fiendish smile broke out across Kazuko's face, her eyes obscured by the droplets of rain that hit them.

"You wouldn't stab an unarmed woman, would you?"

"You're not gonna *have arms* if you keep making fun of me!" she yelped as Kazuko laughed at her, the pair giggling as she swung her limp arm like a puppet.

<!-- Specifically designed to evoke the feeling of how Hitomi, Madoka, and Sayaka messing about in ep. 1 feels to watch.  Childish but familiar. -->
"Oh no, *my arms!*  What ever will I do, I'll have to tell Tomohisa that the wild swordsman Junko has disarmed me!"  Her voice was dripping with sarcasm as Junko's rage began to percolate.

"H-Hey, wait!  Don't you dare bring him into this!"

She raised a threatening eyebrow in response as Junko collapsed onto the bench in a disgruntled pile.

Kazuko smugly hummed a victory theme as her partner in crime conceded.

"Truce?"

"Truce."

"Thank goodness.  I don't want my stuff to get *soggy* in a fight anyways."

"Where the hell *is* this bus anyways?" she muttered, as a beat-up transit bus curled the corner and arrived at the bus stop just in front of the school.  

"Fucking finally." Kazuko admitted candidly, Junko nodding with a weak recognition.   She was *exhausted*.

--- 

The quiet scraping of something in the bus woke Kazuko up, their ride home abruptly coming to a halt.  She fixed her glasses, shaking slightly as she realized that the front of the bus was *gone*.  Not messy, not blurry, *gone*.

"Junko.  Junko, wake up..." she muttered, elbowing her friend nervously as Junko jabbed drowsily back.

"C'mon Kazuko, I was sleep—  Wait, I was _sleeping_ what the..."

Junko stared in disbelief at the front of the bus, the trail of white powder slowly inching towards them making her slightly more than a little uncomfortable.

*It almost looks like... a big sugar cube?*

Junko grabbed her fencing kit and backpack as Kazuko did the same, the girls carefully avoiding the white cuboid that turned to face them as they exited through the "front door" of their transportation.

They were, distinctly, not in Mitakihara anymore.  The peaceful, if somewhat run down port that the bus ran next to before cutting back inland had been replaced with a jarring landscape of paper trees in bold colors, as discordant chimes from what sounded like a music box continued in the distance.

<!-- BGM: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvG7Fo3xA7U">Umbra Nigra (PMMM Soundtrack)</a> -->

"What... is this place..."

"I... don't know..." Junko responded nervously.  "There isn't a fair or something our bus driver crashed at by accident?"

Neither girl wanted to think about what happened to the bus driver when the front of the bus was seemingly ripped off.

"It must be... keep looking for an exit."

When they had boarded, it was just them and the bus driver, as was usual for their route home.  Neither girl had expected an adventure, and both desperately wanted an escape.  Instead, they found more sugar cubes.

The small cube, about the size of a cat, had seemingly been replaced with a small voxel army.  Piles of off-white, coarse cubes had continued to appear in the landscape.  Some behind trees, some as stepping stones.  

"This is... too much..." Kazuko insisted, before sitting down on the cube, her hands resting on the object before recoiling in horror.

The surface had clung to her hands slightly, sticky and saccharine.

"They *are* sugar cubes, what the hell?" she mumbled, before the cube fractured into pieces, revealing jagged teeth that attempted to chew back at her sampling.

"EEK!" she yelped, as Junko kicked the cube onto its side.  The creature writhed uncontrollably, unable to right itself, as the others surrounding them continued to fracture and yield sharp, gnashing teeth.

"We *gotta go!*" Junko screamed, as the pair continued running, unaware that admist the forest and the trees, and perched neatly on an undisturbed Sweet-Tooth was an interloper. <!-- the familiar's name, I've decided. -->

*Curious.*

---




- (a bus drives right into a labyrinth, the weather has them be the only ones on it other than the driver.  they fall asleep to find the front half of the bus eaten off.)
- Saotome wants _nothing_ to do with it but apparently has a knack for nearly getting killed.  
- Junko just keeps her foil on her, better than nothing.  It gets enchanted.  
- She nearly chops a guys hand off with it because of that though; oops!
- They get dragged along on witch hunts because their new friend (Naoko) is... not good at being alone and wants friends.  Saotome feels obligation (family?) and Junko wants Kazuko to not get fucking killed.

## Act 2 - Heatdeath

- a witch nearly kills Naoko, severely injured, Kyubey pushing them to contract, Junko promptly kicking the bastard for being creepy.
- "you're just like the guys at school, you little devil."
- Naoko needs a grief seed, but they don't know of any other magical girls.  their peer gives them a phone number and they find themselves on a train to kazamino.
- Naoko friend is _cold_ to the touch, barely holding on
- (new magical girl, does she do charity?  she does!)
- "You're... normies." 
- "We're trying to help a friend.  She got real hurt."
- "Well, either kill a witch yourself or you'll have to kill one in your apartment if you're not quick enough."

## Act 3 - Half-Life
- Junko breaking down.  Kinda does a Sayaka on familiars, even without contracting.  Reckless, stupid.
- Kazuko drags her back from the brink, a breakdown confession over not wanting her to get hurt.  She couldn't continue if she knew she got hurt doing... this.
- the Kazamino girl saves their ass and goes "you're being stupid.  my girlfriend can help hold down Kazamino until I get back."
- "Girlfriend?"
- "Don't you know magical girls are gay as hell?"
- "I-uh... no.  But it explains a few things."

## Epilogue

- Junko gets the "irregularity" speech from Kyubey, she swears off contracting.
- Kunogi Aki (Mrs. Aki, Mabayu's mother) wipes Saotome's memory of magical girls for her own safety and health.
- Junko keeps it, not wanting to forget that none day the cabbity bastard might come crawling back.
