## Act 1 - Urban Decay

<!-- 1993 Okushiri earthquake https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Okushiri_earthquake?useskin=vector -->
Kaname Junko <!-- The characters in her first name mean "詢" (to consult with) and "子" (child) respectively.--> *hated* the pouring rain, huddling in the bus stop as she prayed for the next bus to arrive on time.  The area around school was under construction as of late, and despite best efforts, their escapes home tended to be unpredictable at the best of times.

"It'll either arrive in eight minutes, fifteen, or not at all."

Junko scowled back at Saotome Kazuko, <!-- The characters in her last name mean "早" (quickly), "乙" (secondary), and "女" (woman) respectively.
    The characters in her first name mean "和" (harmony) and "子" (child) respectively. --> ever the persistent bookworm she was.  She had memorized most of the timetable through force of habit, and sheer force of will.  Junko couldn't help but admire her a little for it.

"Hmph."

"Next time when I *tell you* to pack an umbrella, actually *get one* please?"

"How was *I* supposed to know a little rain turned into a typhoon!" she yelped, gesturing wildly at the torrent outside of their meager bus shelter.

"Same way as everyone else... listen to the weather report!  Or ask your parents, I don't know!"

Junko remained silent, sulking quietly as she digested just how *right* she was and how *little* she wanted to admit it.  This back and fourth was emblematic of their friendship, she thought, many assuming the bookish girl to be intelligent and reserved; she was nothing of the sort in the right company.

And so on their worst days their tempers got the best of them, leading to many a screaming match assuaged by shitty ramen <!-- . o O ( City uncooked-ramen scene but with Junko ) --> and snacks they brought to school that they definitely shouldn't have had.

Junko *conveniently* forgot to tell her family that the principal <!-- ? --> had called her a delinquent, and Kazuko *conveniently* went home with some reading materials that a girl of her upbringing probably wouldn't have otherwise.  Her parents didn't want her reading anything "indecent", and so she "didn't".

They both cherished their friendship, even if they did still butt heads about boys.

"So, how was fencing?"

"Same as usual.  Kicked some ass." she grinned wildly, Kazuko rolling her eyes at the bravado.

"And that means *losing* half your matches?"

"I went 5-3 today!  Take it back or I'll add *you* to my list of defeats!"

A fiendish smile broke out across Kazuko's face, her eyes obscured by the droplets of rain that hit them.

"You wouldn't stab an unarmed woman, would you?"

"You're not gonna *have arms* if you keep making fun of me!" she yelped as Kazuko laughed at her, the pair giggling as she swung her limp arm like a puppet.

<!-- Specifically designed to evoke the feeling of how Hitomi, Madoka, and Sayaka messing about in ep. 1 feels to watch.  Childish but familiar. -->
"Oh no, *my arms!*  What ever will I do, I'll have to tell Tomohisa that the wild swordsman Junko has disarmed me!"  Her voice was dripping with sarcasm as Junko's rage began to percolate.

"H-Hey, wait!  Don't you dare bring him into this!"

She raised a threatening eyebrow in response as Junko collapsed onto the bench in a disgruntled pile.

Kazuko smugly hummed a victory theme as her partner in crime conceded.

"Truce?"

"Truce."

"Thank goodness.  I don't want my stuff to get *soggy* in a fight anyways."

"Where the hell *is* this bus anyways?" she muttered, as a beat-up transit bus curled the corner and arrived at the bus stop just in front of the school.  

"Fucking finally." Kazuko admitted candidly, Junko nodding with a weak recognition.   She was *exhausted*.

--- 

The quiet scraping of something in the bus woke Kazuko up, their ride home abruptly coming to a halt.  She fixed her glasses, shaking slightly as she realized that the front of the bus was *gone*.  Not messy, not blurry, *gone*.

"Junko.  Junko, wake up..." she muttered, elbowing her friend nervously as Junko jabbed drowsily back.

"C'mon Kazuko, I was sleep—  Wait, I was _sleeping_ what the..."

Junko stared in disbelief towards the front of the bus, a strange box leaving a trail of white powder slowly inching towards them.  She was, to say the least, a little more than a little uncomfortable.

*It almost looks like... a big sugar cube?* <!-- what else would it look like? -->

Junko grabbed her fencing kit and backpack as Kazuko stood on the seats, the girls carefully avoiding the white cuboid as they advanced towards the front of the bus.  Kazuko would have validated their tickets, had there been a "front door" to depart through; alas. 

She sighed and carefully avoided the jaggged metal edges of the bus, ripped open like a can of sardines.

They were, distinctly, not in Mitakihara anymore.  The peaceful, if somewhat run-down port that the bus ran through before cutting back inland had been replaced rather abruptly.  What once was the odor of fish and diesel had been supplanted by a jarring landscape of paper trees in bold colors, discordant chimes from what sounded like a music box carried on the saccharine winds.

<!-- BGM: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvG7Fo3xA7U">Umbra Nigra (PMMM Soundtrack)</a> -->

"What... is this place..."

"I... don't know..." Junko responded nervously.  "There isn't a fair or something...  Our bus driver didn't crash by accident?"

"Doesn't sound like any heaven I've ever been told about..."

Junko gulped nervously.

"How 'bout the other place?"

"Neither has sugar cubes..."

Neither girl wanted to think about what happened to the bus driver when the front of the bus was seemingly ripped off.

"Well we must be *somewhere*.  Let's keep looking for an exit."

When they had boarded, it was just them and the bus driver, as was usual for their route home.  Neither girl had expected an adventure, and both desperately wanted an escape.  Instead, as they wandered, all theu found were more sugar cubes.

Their first encounter with the odd geography had been about the size of a cat, seemingly one of thousands as they continued to roam.  Some cubes were nestled behind trees, some present as stepping stones, all slightly gritty in appearance.  

After what felt like an eternity, the girls wanted to give up.  "This is... too much..." Kazuko insisted, sitting down on the cube nearest to her in dismay.  As her hands brushed against the surface of the cube, she recoiled in horror.

The surface had clung to her hands slightly; sticky and saccharine when she had expected coarseness like sandpaper or a rockface.

"They *are* sugar cubes, what the hell?" she mumbled as she sniffed at her hands, the sugarcube fracturing into pieces underneath her.

Junko leapt back to her feet as Kazuko jumped towards her, her momentary seat yielding jagged teeth where her body had been mere moments prior.

She didn't even have time to yell before Junko kicked the cube onto its side.  The creature writhed on its side, unable to right itself, other cubes nearby responding to the crunching of sucrose teeth and starting to move towards them.  

"We *gotta go!*" Junko screamed, the pair running further into the forest, blissfully aware of an interloper.  Perched neatly on the floor beneath a tree with fruit that looked like porcelain, was a beady-eyed cabbit. <!-- the familiar's name is a Sweetooth (or Jakob, inventor of the sugarcube perhaps?), I've decided. -->

---

As the girls sprinted through the forest, the trees began to form patterns, guiding them forwards and backwards, through areas that seemed to double back on themselves.  

The forest was playing tricks on them.

"So... we know the lil cubes are ANGRY."

"THEY HAVE TEETH WHY DO THEY HAVE TEETH" she yelped, cradling herself as she rocked on the ground slightly.

"DON"T ASK ME!" 

As the path ran into a corner, the girls progress through the maze ground to a screeching halt.  Junko spun in circles once or twice, desperate to find a way through as the trees converged into a path too narrow to escape through.  

They were trapped.

"Okay so... no path forward...  What do we do..."

"They're... sugar cubes.  Water dissolves sugar."

"I have a half liter of water from fencing practice."

"My water bottle is empty..."

"Kazuko!"

"*What!*  I always empty it before I get on the bus so I'm not hauling around water!  My backpack is heavy *enough*!"

"Ugh... what else. I have my sabre, but that's not good for *fighting fighting*.

"It's better than my *lack of umbrella...*"

"Right, the umbrella!" she exclaimed, before extending it into a makeshift baton.

"If they get close, bat at 'em with this!"

"And what if I can hit them... I'm not... sporty like you."

"Then just open the umbrella!  It's a shield too!" she grinned as Kazuko's nervousness faded slightly.

"Let's do this." she steeled herself as the cubes rolled in, the jarring thud of their bodies rolling like dice across the surface of the labyrinth.

<!--
- (a bus drives right into a labyrinth, the weather has them be the only ones on it other than the driver.  they fall asleep to find the front half of the bus eaten off.)
- Saotome wants _nothing_ to do with it but apparently has a knack for nearly getting killed.  
- Junko just keeps her foil on her, better than nothing.  It gets enchanted.  
- She nearly chops a guys hand off with it because of that though; oops!
- They get dragged along on witch hunts because their new friend (Naoko) is... not good at being alone and wants friends.  Saotome feels obligation (family?) and Junko wants Kazuko to not get fucking killed.

## Act 2 - Heatdeath

- a witch nearly kills Naoko, severely injured, Kyubey pushing them to contract, Junko promptly kicking the bastard for being creepy.
- "you're just like the guys at school, you little devil."
- Naoko needs a grief seed, but they don't know of any other magical girls.  their peer gives them a phone number and they find themselves on a train to kazamino.
- Naoko friend is _cold_ to the touch, barely holding on
- (new magical girl, does she do charity?  she does!)
- "You're... normies." 
- "We're trying to help a friend.  She got real hurt."
- "Well, either kill a witch yourself or you'll have to kill one in your apartment if you're not quick enough."

## Act 3 - Half-Life
- Junko breaking down.  Kinda does a Sayaka on familiars, even without contracting.  Reckless, stupid.
- Kazuko drags her back from the brink, a breakdown confession over not wanting her to get hurt.  She couldn't continue if she knew she got hurt doing... this.
- the Kazamino girl saves their ass and goes "you're being stupid.  my girlfriend can help hold down Kazamino until I get back."
- "Girlfriend?"
- "Don't you know magical girls are gay as hell?"
- "I-uh... no.  But it explains a few things."

## Epilogue

- Junko gets the "irregularity" speech from Kyubey, she swears off contracting.
- Kunogi Aki (Mrs. Aki, Mabayu's mother) wipes Saotome's memory of magical girls for her own safety and health.
- Junko keeps it, not wanting to forget that none day the cabbity bastard might come crawling back.
