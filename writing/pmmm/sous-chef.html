<h2 id="sous-chef">Sous-Chef</h2>
<p>Akemi Homura was, for lack of a better word, pathetic. She was sure
that others thought if of her, to say nothing of how she saw herself.
She had narrowly escaped death on her first day of school, before
developing a blisteringly parasocial crush and falling right into
end-of-the-world circumstances. Such was the life of a <em>mahou
shoujo</em> it seemed.</p>
<p>“Akemi-san, more tea?” Tomoe Mami smiled, her gracious host utterly
at ease with the practice. Homura nodded quickly and flashed a smile,
trying to push out the sound of gunfire. Ever since Homura saw Mami kill
her once-upon-a-situationship with a musket on a train station platform,
it had been hard to hide how <em>afraid</em> she made her.</p>
<p>Mercifully, she was better at lying than she was at cooking.</p>
<p>“Akemi-san, could I ask you to help in the kitchen? Ribbons only go
so far for free hands.”</p>
<p>This Mami was, thus far, spared that truth.</p>
<p>“O-Of course Mami-san.”</p>
<p>Mami gestured towards the kitchen as Homura followed suit, stepping
inside the kitchen alcove to reveal an already simmering stockpot.</p>
<p>Homura washed her hands before sliding down to the chopping board at
the “station” next to the sink.</p>
<p>She picked up the knife and weighed it in her hands. Lighter than a
Beretta, more elegant than a Desert Eagle or Glock. An thought shot
through her, as instinctual as anything else. Where to swing, where to
throw, how fast to hurl the blade.</p>
<p>She dismissed the thought, ashamed of herself. An elegant weapon? No,
the knife was a requisite tool and little more.</p>
<p>“Start with the celery, then the carrots. If you’re feeling bold,
there’s some melon we can dice up for a treat with lunch tomorrow.”</p>
<p>She nodded promptly, and moved her shaking fingers to try and protect
her knuckles. Something she had seen in her cooking of <em>less than
common</em> substances for her awaiting death at the end of the
month.</p>
<p><em>At least learning to cook properly might make me a little less
useless. Madoka can work and I’ll—</em></p>
<p>She began with the celery and quickly fell into a rhythm, hoping the
blush on her cheeks faded quickly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kyoko was crashing on her couch. Until ten minutes prior to her
asking, Homura Akemi hadn’t <em>had</em> a couch. She was already in the
habit of turning off the holo-projectors when they weren’t in use. She
figured her dusty, state-funded apartment would be more sympathetic.</p>
<p>“S-Sorry about the mess.”</p>
<p>“Beats the street. I’ve had worse when I was at th—” she began,
cutting herself off as she chomped down onto her Rocky.</p>
<p>Homura (smartly) chose to not push her on where she got it.</p>
<p>“Oh, Kyoko-san—”</p>
<p>“Akemi… Can it with the honorifics. We’re just girls.”</p>
<p>[ homura wakes up to find her cooking breakfast. ]</p>
<p>[ what are you doing? ]</p>
<p>[ I slept at yours. Only fair. ]</p>
<p>[ This… seems unexpectedly generous. ]</p>
<p>[ Parents raised me right y’ass. (enraged)]</p>
<p>[ I never said anything about your parents. ]</p>
<p>[ Well when the times were good, y’know, momo and i would help our
mom with the baked goods, anything to get congregants to stick around.
]</p>
<p>[ Did it work…? ]</p>
<p>[ Kinda. Folks kept comin’ but they never stuck around. And the uh…
when my father found out about my wish. ]</p>
<p>[ I’m sorry. ]</p>
<p>[ So what was yours for? ]</p>
<p>[ she doesn’t respond quickly. she just keeps working on the dough.

<hr />
<p>Homura’s glasses rested firmly in the pocket dimension of her
buckler. Even had she still needed them, they would have done little to
protect her from the barrage.</p>
<p>The onions were <em>potent</em>, far beyond anything Mami-san had
gotten in prior loops. She practically lurched when she first split one
open. But no, Mami had <em>happened</em> across a girl on the street and
felt it her moral duty to help. And so, they were cooking a generous
portion of pasta for the girl and her community, damn her idealistic
heart.</p>
<p>Homura made quick work of onions and set them to simmer, before
squeezing in a gratuitous blob of tomato paste.</p>
<p>“Tomoe-san, I believe the sauce is set for an hour or two.”</p>
<p>Mami was still deep in the baking process, attempting to make cookies
en-masse. Blob after blob of cookie dough sat chilling in the fridge,
unexpectedly full for the first time in many years. Her apartment
kitchen was luxurious by most standards, but industrial scale it was
not, despite her ambitions.</p>
<p>“Sounds like enough time to put on a movie and some tea. Kyoko, would
you like anything?”</p>
<p>Homura washed her hands and quickly made her way to the couch as
Kyoko responded in part with a dissinterested grunt.</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a no then.”</p>
<p>She “Th’ hell is your deal anyways? Isn’t there some big bad witch
comin’ t’ town? Isn’t like… getting grief seeds more important than yer
lil’ domestic thing?”</p>
<p>She had a frown on her face, slightly more irate than usual.
Walpurgisnacht <em>would</em> arrive in eight days; she was right.</p>
<p>Homura had behaved irrationally this loop too, a twinge of guilt
coarsing through her. She had <em>sworn</em> not to rely on anyone else
so authoritative, and here she was…</p>
<p>But she wasn’t dependent on anyone else, she told herself.</p>
<p><em>I need this. We both need this. All of us do.</em></p>
<p>She was just opting to do <em>additional</em> good in the
process.</p>
<p>Besides, the charity cooking was essential if it kept Tomoe Mami
alive long enough to fight Walpurgisnacht.</p>
<p>“Yes. Walpurgisnacht is arriving soon, but cooking helps me collect
my thoughts. As does food help you with yours.”</p>
<p>Kyoko scoffed in response as she ripped open another box of
Rocky.</p>
<p>Homura swiftly moved to avoid a train of thought so ruinous it might
still catch her in the blast radius. A thought so treasonous that it
might kill her. The very simple idea that she missed her
<em>senpai</em>.</p>
<p>Then again, she knew if she had explained the circumstances that
Madoka would be supportive. She always was, even if she usually
contracted afterwards…</p>
<p><em>It’s not cheating, we’re not even dating!</em></p>
<p>Homura resolved to ask Madoka for tomatoes from her father’s garden
next loop.</p>
<p><em>It’s not quite a dinner date, but—</em></p>
<p>She took a deep breath on the couch, and enjoyed the stolen
peace.</p>
<hr />
<p>[ Loop 33 - she totally fucks up a super long cooking dish. Keeps
calling apart. Mami asks her to step out of the kitchen while she cleans
up ]</p>
<p>Homura goes to reset and paused when mami arrives with a very beat up
musket.</p>
<p>She starts to clean her guns habitually. Mami asks if she can clean
her muskets. “But they’re magic”</p>
<p>“So is teamwork, akemi-san.”</p>
<p>Loop 45, kyokō is revealed to be an excellent chef when cooking in
high quantities. She blames it on the church. She refuses to do sweets
though… (Momo)</p>
<hr />
<p>[End of September, Homura asks Mami and Kyoko for help baking a cake.
She doesn’t need help, but she needs the company. ]</p>
<p>[ She sings happy birthday to Madoka. ]</p>
