<p>Sofia swung the door to the band room open and found one of her classmates in a glittering, radiant outfit evocative of every design she’d seen in Akibahara.</p>
<p>“So you’re a magical girl.”</p>
<p>“Uh… yep. Magical girl.”</p>
<p>Charlie was sweating profusely, purely a psychosomatic response to the circumstances. She knew that Sofia would catch her one of these days if her persistent stalking had continued.</p>
<p>Why did she have to do so on a day she had a date though?</p>
<p>“I <em>really</em> have got to be going.” Charlie mumbled, Sofia having none of it.</p>
<p>“And what, run off to go fight the evils of the night?”</p>
<p>“See you get how it works so, just—”</p>
<p>Sofia’s foot hit the door behind her and shut.</p>
<p>“Tell me more.”</p>
<p>She already knew she was going to regret it. She just had no idea when.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sofia being able to see the Incubator was a recent development.</p>
<p>Kyubey had said something to one of the D.C. girls she talked to online at one point, something that worked its way through the grapevine. An idea that magical girls can be of significance enough to act as “karmic anchors”, dragging others around them into the fight against entropy.</p>
<p>She dismissed the idea outright; how pompous would she have to be to think it was about <em>her</em>? Even a little bit? Besides, that Incubator had revealed to have come down with a case of individualized emotions and was promptly removed from its population.</p>
<p>On the other hand, she just didn’t expect Kyubey to drag Sofia into her world so abruptly. Her girlfriend of three years was gawking at her in costume like a fangirl, and on a day when she was run especially ragged.</p>
<p>She still had two mostly-used seeds, she’d survive the night, she’d survived worse. Sofia’s judgement was immense.</p>
<p>“Sofia don’t you <em>fucking dare.</em>”</p>
<p>“But you’re worn out, it’s clearly getting to you. Not like you can quit otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Don’t. Please don’t.”</p>
<p>“Kyubey?”</p>
<p><em>— Yes Sofia? —</em></p>
<p>“I wish she wasn’t a magical girl anymore.” she said, Charlie in utter shock at her girlfriend’s audacity.</p>
<p>The colorless wind that erupted around her left her heaving, as she watched a replica of her costume appear on her girlfriend.</p>
<hr />
<p>“You’re going to get yourself <em>KILLED!</em>”</p>
<p>“So no difference then.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do you <em>know</em> what my life expectancy was before?”</p>
<p>“… no?”</p>
<p>“You contract and didn’t even think to ask? You STILL didn’t know? What the FUCK is WRONG WITH YOU.”</p>
<p>“I… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Sorry doesn’t make me _comfortable in my body, you idiot.”</p>
<p>“I… I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>Kyubey was already gone when she tried to find the bastard to asphyxiate. She knew it didn’t breathe but needed the stress relief. Unfortunately, her next target had already vanished; Nobody enjoys being pummeled even if you have spare bodies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Charlie ends up spending more than an hour shopping for rings. Of course, silver isn’t a popular color and the stock in-person isn’t as good as it used to be, but she had to try.</p>
<p>She walked away exhausted and disappointed. None of them feel the <em>same</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Their classmates assume that their relationship imploded, of course. They went from holding hands to fuming at the sight of one another. Or rather, Charlie fumed while Sofia looks heartbroken.</p>
<p>“Did she propose?”</p>
<p>“Huh? No. Fuck off Julie.”</p>
<p>“But she has that ring…”</p>
<p>Charlie doesn’t talk to her for the rest of the day. She got the message.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sofia was posting in the local MG groupchat, of course she was.</p>
<p>“First patrol, any tips?” she posted, a selfie of her glittering costume a near replica of the one she wore on patrol.</p>
<p>She buried her face in her pillows again. She resisted the urge to ban her, barely.</p>
<p>She figured she should be responsible, gave her the appropriate roles for their neighborhood. An instant later, she had removed her own, letting “KYU8” automatically kick her from the server. Inactive members generally got purged somewhat regularly to insulate the new girls from the mortality rate, but she was active.</p>
<p>Others might read it as her moving away. She was active the week prior, after all, having bought at least two of them drinks.</p>
<p>If they were curious, her neck of the woods had a new magical girl anyways.</p>
<p>Sofia would fill in the gaps if she wanted to.</p>
<hr />
<p>She felt like shit. The worst, the <em>most</em> she’d felt in months. Years maybe. Magical girls don’t get to <em>retire</em> and here she was, evicted of her lifeblood and bleeding. Needing nutrition and medication, glasses and acne patches again.</p>
<p>She checked her phone. 2:37AM. She fucking hated having a sleep schedule. She tossed and turned, the only dreams she would have relating to the type of girl she wasn’t anymore. She tried to ignore the hot flashes.</p>
<p>She failed.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>[2:41AM] cod: You up?
         sof: Of course!  You okay?
         cod: no
[2:46AM] sof: ...
         cod: can you come over?  I just need to see you.</code></pre>
<p>They sit in an uncomfortable silence. The city still swells when they look at it, both girls feeling small like they used to.</p>
<p>“How did your first patrol go?”</p>
<p>“It was… okay.”</p>
<p>“Do you wanna talk about it?”</p>
<p>“Not like I can see for myself now.”</p>
<p>“Well.. Turns out my wish made me nullify most magical girl powers. Nobody likes me.”</p>
<p>Charlie doesn’t respond for a moment, trying to choose her words carefully.</p>
<p>“So you ruined my life… and you don’t even get to enjoy yours?”</p>
<p>“That’s the bargain. You better enjoy your life, Charlie.” she said through grit teeth.</p>
<p>Charlie was suddenly not there, her mind a million miles away. Ideating, ideating was a luxury she <em>never</em> truly had before. Now though, she was <em>glad</em> for it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Charlie was holding a knife, standing across the cold linoleum. Sofia was leaning slightly against the doorframe next to the open window. The chill of the late fall gave her breath a clouding that told Charlie everything she needed to know.</p>
<p>Sofia was <em>warm</em>. She was still acting human.</p>
<p>“Come on Charlie, I won’t hurt you.” she said firmly, her eyes glittering like gemstones as tears formed.</p>
<p>“Good to know.” she acknowledged plainly before lunging at her. Charlie moved to step beside, the side-step quicker than she had been able to prior; It came with the contract. Sofia was at least a little suprised to hear the knife let out a <em>twang</em> as it gouged the flooring.</p>
<p>Her hand caught hers again, that familiar touch suddenly inverted, warmth cold and the chill warm. Human and magical girl in all the wrong proportions.</p>
<p>Just as quickly she was gone, fetal position on the floor.</p>
<p>Sofia goes to transform, and finds herself unable to, gasping as she stares at her hand. Her ring is gone. Her soul gem, <em>she</em> is gone from her body.</p>
<p>That means Charlie—</p>
<p>Charlie is still curled up on the floor, ugly sobbing. She’s not sure if she’s feeling her shuddder as the heaving fills the room, or if that familiar warmth over her soul is bridging the gap.</p>
<p>“Charlie…”</p>
<p>The girl stays curled on the floor, a bubble of snot sliding down her face.</p>
<p>So she stands, and she stays on the ground, stolen peace returned in part.</p>
<p>“100 meters. Stay within 100 meters or your body will go out of range.”</p>
<p>“huh?” she mumbles, the numbness washing over her.</p>
<p>She stays the night on the couch. Sofia doesn’t quite know how to process that she was, in fact, upstairs in bed with Charlie, while her <em>body</em> was on the couch downstairs. To describe it as compromising would be an egregious understatement.</p>
<p>Charlie’s parents don’t notice the gouge in the floor, but then again, they didn’t notice their son become their daughter either.</p>
<hr />
<p>[ the ending. ]</p>
