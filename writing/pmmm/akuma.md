The transfer student nodded quietly as she did her classwork, not ignorant to the fact her peers kept sneaking glances.  She was doing her best to be studious, to focus on her work, but even then, she wasn't perfect.

*Fifteen, carry the five...*

Some cold corner of her mind spewed insults at her despite the effort, confident in condescention that she *wanted* to be the center of attention..

*Gold ribbons; gold, really?  What were you thinking?  Too bold, too flashy, too attention-seeking.*

The gentle scribbling of her pencil paused for a moment, burying the thought with practiced precision.  Intrusive thoughts wouldn't get her missed assignments done any quicker unless her subconscious was secretly a math protégé. 

*You're not one of those chuunibyos are you?*

As Madoka continued her math assignment, Homura continued to watch her beloved.  She likened herself to an ornithologist, utterly entranced with the bird in the cage as she continued through her utterly mundane life.  She tried her best to ignore that she was the reason the bird was in the cage, but better trapped than dead she figured.

She hoped she did a good job, after all.  She had given careful attention given to her "time in America", her fake habitat built in the ruins of the real one to the best of her ability.  She only omitted that one deadly detail.  Even the changes made for enrichment seemed to be working though, ballet taken up with grace and sophistication.  

She was hopeful that the story she'd crafted, the careful revisions would live up to the expectations and needs of the girl she'd burn the universe for.  She hoped so desperately that she could help Madoka to live a normal life.  But then again, she wasn't very experienced as an autor, and the stakes were far higher than life and death. 

Failure was simply not an option. 

Oh, if only Madoka had the chance to live her life the first time around, oh so many months ago.  Instead, her cotton-candy haired angel had gone and become a goddess, all because of that damn interstellar interloper.  Her soul to save a cat, and the rest was history.  

Only when Homura felt sufficiently confident there were no lingering threats, she permitted her attention to drift.  As her mind departed Mitakihara and crossed the poles, she couldn't help but recognize how foregin this power was to her.  

Being able to move through the world like shadow was a fairly recent revelation, one which she was reluctant to attribute to her better half.  After all, to sneak through space by folding it like tissue-paper like she did so often now was absolutely unbecoming of a goddess.  Luckily, Homura was no such being, and neither was Madoka now.   She was no longer the Law of Cycles, it existed without her now.

A just universe would *never* have rewarded her with *more power* as a result of her cardinal sin;  A universe with kindness was dead after what she had done.

She sighed quietly as she summoned her beloved's weapon; it was an indefinite loan given the circumstances.  Somewhere in the American heartlands and under cover of night, Akemi Homura drew her bow.  She had wraiths to exterminate.

Madoka turned around to find Homura asleep, the girl seemingly resolute even in her dreams.  She had guessed that she might find some respite, but no, apparently not.

Madoka smiled sympathetically, the girl *did* seem tired.  Even when she was confident or elegant (constantly),  she still seemed *so, so tired*.

*Madoka.* 

Her head spun as if on a swivel as she tried fruitlessly to find the source of that unfamiliar voice.  Instead of finding a source to that uncanny, child-like call, she found Sayaka Miki.  Her once best friend slapped her hand on her desk, laying obvious claim to her attention.

"C'mon Madoka.  We're getting lunch!  There's *no way* you're getting out of your stories in the *Americas* that easily!"

"O-Oh!  Okay Sayaka-chan... Just..." she murmured as she stood up, glancing back at the still sleeping Homura.

"Come *on!*  If Hitomi gets to start yammering about Kyouske she'll *never stop!* Sayaka pleaded, tugging gently on the cuff of her uniform.

"Sayaka-chan!" Madoka yelped, scuffing her feet against the perfectly polished floors as Sayaka dragged her further away, and so she left the raven-haired girl asleep at her desk.

*I hope she feels better soon...*

"So Madoka—" Sayaka began confidently, waving around a french fry with gusto.

"What did you get up to in America?  Hobbies?  Clubs?  Did you find a *boyfriend*?" she jeered.

"Oh uh.... I started to take ballet classes.  Mama thought it was a good idea, and it's fun, but it's hard."

"So elegant, so *regal!* Sayaka pantomimed, as Madoka giggled at the silly pose.  Just like Sayaka, like she never left.

"Okay but..." Sayaka poised, eyebrows waggling.

"Any boyfriend?" 

Her eyes glimmering with excitement,  Hitomi watching with mute curiosity.  Was this *really* the way she would greet an old friend?

"N-No... no boys." she stammered in response, Sayaka collapsing in her chair with disappointment.

"C'mon, you were gone for *years* and it's like you never left!  You only took up ballet... No boys, please tell me you at least got to see the sights!"

"Perhaps she was simply focused on her studies, Sayaka?" Hitomi resolved with perfect poise, the sheer ego on that girl.

"Oh... yeah I guess that makes sense.  Your family was there for your Mom's work, right..."

"Yeah..   Mama got told by work we had to move, and that was that..." she mumbled in response, looking down at the lunch her father packed her.  The same as always, a home-made meal packed perfectly with attention and care.  

The same but different.  A different place, a different rice cooker, a different cut of meat from a different butcher.

Hitomi began to wonder aloud "I wonder if not boys, did you-" before she stopped herself short, letting out a quiet gasp.  Madoka was *crying*.

"Oh shoot, I'm so sorry, was it—" Sayaka stuttered, shaking slightly as Madoka sniffled and wiped up her tears.

"Sorry....I... I forgot how much I missed you guys."

"Aw..." Sayaka mumbled as the group hugged happily.

"We missed you too.  This place wasn't the same without you." she said confidently, before she heard a cough.

"Ahem." Kyoko rasped, holding her lunch and glaring at the reunited friend group.

"Oh h-hi.  I don't think we've met yet." Madoka said warmly, the peeved look on Kyoko's face fading slightly.

"Nah.  But everyone knows pinky.  You're back a day and already have a gang."

Madoka's face was wash with confusion.  Was she upset with her?  Did she think Madoka was replacing her?

The firely interloper reached into her lunchbox and procured a box of Rocky, ripping it open and waving the open end at the pink-haired prodigal daughter.

"Welcome back to Mitakihara, pinky." she smiled, as Madoka took the stick of Rocky with a smile.

"Thank you for the warm welcome!" she beamed.
