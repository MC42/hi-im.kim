# Akuma

The transfer student nodded quietly as she did her classwork, not ignorant to the fact her peers kept sneaking glances.  She was doing her best to be studious, to focus on her work.

*Fifteen, carry the five...*

Some cold corner of her mind spewed insults at her all the same, assuring her she *wanted* to be the center of attention so badly.

*Gold ribbons; gold, really?  What were you thinking?  Too bold, too flashy, too attention-seeking."

She shook her head and continued with her work.  Intrusive thoughts wouldn't get them done any quicker, unless the nagging of her subconscious was a maths protégé. 

*You're not one of those chuunibyos are you?*

Homura continued to watch her beloved, utterly entranced as she continued through her utterly mundane life.  And what a mundane life it was, careful attention given to her "time in America", to taking up ballet with grace and sophistication.  

She was hopeful that the story she'd crafted would live up to the brilliant woman she'd get to become.  She *had* to have hope.

If only Madoka had the chance to be normal the first time, so many years, so many repeated months ago.  But she gave her all for a cat, and now...

...

Only when Homura felt sufficiently confident there were no lingering threats, Homura permitted her attention to drift.  As her mind departed Mitakihara and crossed the poles, she recounted how foregin this power was to her.  

Being able to move through the world like shadow was a fairly recent revalation, one which she was reluctant to attribute to her better half.  After all, to sneak through space and time like she did so often now was absolutely unbecoming a goddess of her stature.  Then again, she was no longer the Law of Cycles, it existed without her now.

A just universe would *never* have rewarded her with *more power* as a result of her cardinal sin.  A universe with kindness was dead after what she had done.

She sighed quietly as she summoned her beloved's weapon; it was an indefinite loan given the circumstances.  Somewhere in the darkness of night in the American heartlands, she had wraiths to exterminate.

Madoka turned around to find Homura asleep, a smile on her face even in her sleep.

Madoka smiled sympathetically, the girl *did* seem tired.  Even when she was elegant or confident (constantly),  she still seemed *so, so tired*.

*Madoka.* 

Her head spun as if on a swivel as she tried fruitlessly to find the source of that unfamiliar voice.  Instead of finding a source to that uncanny, child-like voice, she found Sayaka Miki.  Her childhood best friend slapped her hand on her desk, laying claim to her lunchtime attention.

"C'mon Madoka.  We're getting food.  There's *no way* you're getting out of your stories in the *Americas* that easily!"

"O-Oh!  Okay Sayaka-chan... Just..." she murmured as she stood up, glancing back at the still sleeping Homura.

"Come *on!*  If Hitomi gets to start yammering about Kyouske she'll *never stop!* Sayaka pleaded, tugging gently on the cuff of her uniform.

"Sayaka-chan, stoppp!" Madoka yelped, as she left the raven-haired girl asleep at her desk.

*I hope she feels better soon...*
