<p>She was sure she was being watched. Sure, she was the transfer student, the transfer student is always the center of attention, especially so late in the year.</p>
<p>Still, her heart condition had limited her options, and the doctors in Mitakihara <em>were</em> the best.</p>
<p>“oh, where did you go to school Akemi-san?” chimed Yuzuki.</p>
<p>“Uh… a small christian school.”</p>
<p>“Christian huh. Girls only or not?” prattled Koito.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why that-”</p>
<p>“Akemi-san, do you have any hobbies?” interrupted Minori.</p>
<p>“I l-like reading!” she stuttered out, her words tripping over themselves like she always did. Pathetic.</p>
<p>“Prolly just <em>yuri</em> or something.”</p>
<p>“Girls that is <em>quite enough.</em>” barked their teacher, the pointer in her hand suddenly much more imposing. The girls halted their barrage, and Homura finally had a chance to breathe.</p>
<p>A voice behind her, calm, collected, let out her name.</p>
<p>“Akemi-san? Hi, I’m—” she turned to face the girl, finding haggard cut blue hair and eyes the same hue, framed by cartoonishly oversized hairclips.</p>
<p><em>Is that sort of thing normal here in Mitakihara?</em></p>
<p>“Right. Uh, I’m Miki Sayaka. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you Miki-san.”</p>
<p>Homura’s nose wrinkled. The girl felt strange, at least a little. Why would she wait for the others to get old off before approaching? Why didn’t Saotome-sensei mind?</p>
<p><em>Does she think I’m a pity case?</em></p>
<p>“I’m uh. Kinda in charge of helping out new folks here.”</p>
<p>“O-Oh.”</p>
<p>Homura tried to not show her frown. A pity case for <em>sure</em> then, same as before. Awful, horrid, disgusting. More than anything she had prayed she wouldn’t be a burden on others, and here she was again…</p>
<p>“I was gonna ask if you had plans for lunch though.”</p>
<p>“Eating?”</p>
<p>“You’re funny Akemi-san. No I mean like… Do you have anyone to <em>eat with</em>?”</p>
<p>“Oh. Uh… no.”</p>
<p>“Wanna eat with my friends?” she grinned, jabbing a finger over her back towards a girl with rolling green hair.</p>
<p><em>Don’t be rude, she tried to be kind to you.</em></p>
<p>“Uh… sure.” Homura meekly let out, grateful she made a friend on her first day back.</p>
<p>Sayaka’s grin only widened, nervously scratching her head before slinking back to her desk.</p>
<p><em>Too strong an introduction?</em></p>
<p><em>For her, seeing you coming wouldn’t have lessened the blow.</em></p>
<p><em>Still. To see her like this…</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Homura watched as her classmates ran on the track, giggling maniacally as they did anything but the assigned exercise. Figures.</p>
<p>She had a medical exemption, but she loathed it with every fiber of her being. To be so <em>weak</em>, so feeble. It felt <em>awful.</em></p>
<p>The sun felt relentless on her chalk-hue skin, so she hid under a nearby oak and tried to enjoy the breeze as best she can.</p>
<p>She watched Sayaka antagonize the green hair girl, the tomboy filling in the gap that her name was Hitomi. Sayaka raced towards her, the moss-toned girl running away with as much grace and poise mortal fear afforded her (apparently quite a bit). Homura just smiled weakly. Calculated, familiar, pacifying.</p>
<p>Her classmates had finished warming up, students taking to ad-hoc activities in the stupefying Mitakihara “open ended classroom” strategy. It was allegedly European, but Homura had certainly never heard of such a thing.</p>
<p>Sayaka took the chance to do hurdles and cleared them with ease. Maybe she was a gymnast?</p>
<p><em>Maybe I get to keep friends this time. Maybe they won’t abandon me like…</em></p>
<p>Homura jolted awake, the sound of shattering glass in her ears as she found herself staring at a pair of gangly legs and shorts.</p>
<p>“Heya Akemi-san!” beamed Sayaka, looming over her.</p>
<p>When <em>did</em> she have the time to sneak up on her? Surely she wasn’t—</p>
<p>The rest of the class had gone inside. Their gym teacher was looming in the doorway, irritated. She had <em>fallen asleep</em>, hadn’t she?</p>
<p>Sayaka reached down a hand and dragged Homura to her feet, not letting go of her hand as they headed back for the interior of the building.</p>
<p>“Sorry…” she squeaked out, Sayaka refusing to even dignify a response.</p>
<p><em>Did she care that much, really?</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The rest of the day finished without interruption. Saotome-sensei had given her a mercy and let her skip some of her missed homework assignments in the run-up to the exam. She’d even let her copy from the examination booklet.</p>
<p>The less-than-ideal portion of this mercy was an immense burden. She had informed Homura that she was expected to pass the major exams from earlier in the year at a much higher interval.</p>
<p>Homura had agreed without a moment of fuss; if she wasn’t good at academics, what <em>was</em> she good at?</p>
<p>She continued the laborious walk across Mitakihara from the middle school to her warded home. Sure, it was out of the way, sure it wasn’t something she <em>chose</em>, but it was in a quiet part of town, and it was <em>expansive</em>.</p>
<p>Shame it never felt <em>lived in</em> though.</p>
<p>She unlocked the door and found herself staring at dusty furniture covered in tarps. She collapsed into the single uncovered loveseat, flicking back on a reading lamp that still had visible fingerprints from when she had turned it on the night prior.</p>
<p>The single incandescent lamp was warm, even when she felt cold, so cold. The nurses had assured her the chills would fade with time, and she prayed they were right. The alternative was too much to bear.</p>
<p>She sighed only once before opening her schoolbag, withdrawing a ratty school-issue copy of the assigned text.</p>
<p>Wasn’t this supposed to be dense for academics in post-secondary? Why were a group of middle schoolers assigned it?</p>
<p>At least it was annotated…</p>
<p>As Homura descended into her assignment, the textual bargain fresh in her mind, she failed to hear the sound of shattered glass somewhere on the street below.</p>
<hr />
<p>The lamp clicked off, and she crawled into bed. she folded her glasses carefully and put them at her side. Maybe she’d have good dreams this time.</p>
<hr />
<p>She was woken up by the sound of a scream, something outside. Homura’s eyes jerked open, laying in bed.</p>
<p>Surely it’s a hallucination. Surely it’s not real. Nothing ever <em>happens</em> in this part of town anyways.</p>
<p>She hears an explosion and the groan of metal scraping against metal. She bolts out of bed and stumbled over to the curtains, ripping them open.</p>
<p>She found herself face to face with her classmate riding on musical notes.</p>
<p>“Ah shit.” Sayaka mumbled, Homura suddenly red in the face at her attire.</p>
<p>“Miki-san, this dream…”</p>
<p>“Not a dream Akemi. Get back to sleep before the nightmare gets worse.”</p>
<p>Homura nodded instinctively, and receded from the window as another volley of something explosive careened past Sayaka, the street below covered in scorch marks.</p>
<p><em>Right, dream logic. Of course I dream she’s a magical girl.</em></p>
<p>Homura descended into the loveseat, closed her eyes and began to count down.</p>
<p><em>Ten, nine, eight.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka winced as the barrage of bullets tore through her cape. She had <em>just</em> spent time fixing it, <em>really!?</em></p>
<p><em>Seven, six, five.</em></p>
<p>A golden figure swung by the window suspended on sunbeam-hued threads. Perfectly retained curls didn’t loosen even slightly as she continued her assault on the magical girl.</p>
<p><em>Four, three.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka swung her shredded cape, pull on her self as she materialized a pile of sabres, launching one after the other at her aggressor. Mami did the same, Sayaka ripping her cape off as the magic ammunition harmlessly dispersed on contact with the accessory. Sayaka huddled around the corner of the alleyway, shivering in fear as Mami steadied her hand.</p>
<p><em>Two, one.</em></p>
<p>Mami raised the musket only slightly, to her skull, no, to her navel, her finger glancing on the trigger.</p>
<p>The clock struck midnight as Mami’s musket dematerialized, her outfit dissolving back into school attire. Sayaka’s fortissimo reverted to an otherwise mundane hairclip set, her skirt returning to a tacky plaid. Mami looked down in disappointment at the collapsed schoolgirl, before walking back into the night..</p>
<p>Sayaka peeked back in to Homura’s window and found the girl fast asleep in the loveseat. She gently stepped in through the still open window, draped her blanket across the girl, and left the same way she entered.</p>
<hr />
<p>Homura woke up to the sound of cicadas creeping in through her slightly ajar window.</p>
<p><em>Had</em> she left her window open the night prior? She wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>She grabbed for her glasses, hand shaky as she unfolded the arms and shoved them onto her face. She reached further, grabbing her medication and a glass she had set out the night prior. </p>
<p>Homura swung her head back as she downed the pills, routine taking over as she let her thoughts wander.</p>
<p><em>What a strange dream, Miki-san from school… a magical girl. And a stranger shooting at her, an attempt on her life? Why something so fantastic?</em></p>
<p>She carefully ran her fingers through her hair, brushing slowly as she ensured no such resistance remained in her nearly waist-length hair.</p>
<p><em>Dreams are just dreams. Nothing more.</em></p>
<p>Homura wasn’t sure, putting a hairtie on the end of her braids, the purple beads perfectly matching her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Surely if she was a magical girl, she wouldn’t have picked me as a friend.</em></p>
<p>She wasn’t sure she believed herself, but kept going all the same.</p>
<p><em>Well, if we’re friends, I’d hope she’d tell me… but it is only the first week I’ve been back. She’s been friends with Shizuki-san for years though, so….</em></p>
<p>An impulsive thought ran through her. Immature, stupid, boorish.</p>
<p>She would simply ask Hitomi. Easy way to dispel such a strange dream.</p>
