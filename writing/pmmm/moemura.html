<p>She was sure she was being watched. Sure, she was the transfer student, the transfer student is always the center of attention, especially so late in the year.</p>
<p>Still, her heart condition had limited her options, and the doctors in Mitakihara <em>were</em> the best.</p>
<p>“Oh, where did you go to school Akemi-san?” chimed Yuzuki.</p>
<p>“Uh… a small christian school.”</p>
<p>“Christian huh. Girls only or not?” prattled Koito.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why that—”</p>
<p>“Akemi-san, do you have any hobbies?” interrupted Minori.</p>
<p>“I l-like reading!” she stuttered out, her words tripping over themselves like she always did. Pathetic.</p>
<p>“Prolly just <em>yuri</em> or something.”</p>
<p>“Girls that is <em>quite enough.</em>” barked their teacher, the pointer in her hand suddenly much more imposing. The girls halted their barrage, and Homura finally had a chance to breathe.</p>
<p>A voice behind her, calm, collected, let out her name.</p>
<p>“Akemi-san? Hi, I’m—” she turned to face the girl, finding haggard cut blue hair and eyes the same hue, framed by cartoonishly oversized hairclips.</p>
<p><em>Is that sort of thing normal here in Mitakihara?</em></p>
<p>“Right. Uh, I’m Miki Sayaka. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you Miki-san.”</p>
<p>Homura’s nose wrinkled. The girl felt strange, at least a little. Why would she wait for the others to get told off before approaching? Why didn’t Saotome-sensei seem to mind?</p>
<p><em>Does she think I’m a pity case?</em></p>
<p>“I’m uh. Kinda in charge of helping out new folks here.”</p>
<p>“O-Oh.”</p>
<p>Homura tried to not show her frown. A pity case for <em>sure</em> then, same as before. Awful, horrid, disgusting. More than anything she had prayed she wouldn’t be a burden on others, and here she was again…</p>
<p>“I was gonna ask if you had plans for lunch though.”</p>
<p>“Eating?”</p>
<p>“You’re funny Akemi-san. No I mean like… Do you have anyone to <em>eat with</em>?”</p>
<p>“Oh. Uh… no.”</p>
<p>“Wanna eat with my friends?” she grinned, jabbing a finger over her back towards a girl with rolling green hair.</p>
<p><em>Don’t be rude, she tried to be kind to you.</em></p>
<p>“Uh… sure.” Homura meekly let out, grateful she made a friend on her first day back.</p>
<p>Sayaka’s grin only widened, nervously scratching her head before slinking back to her desk.</p>
<p><em>Too strong an introduction?</em></p>
<p><em>For her, seeing you coming wouldn’t have lessened the blow.</em></p>
<p><em>Still. To see her like this…</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Homura watched as her classmates ran on the track, giggling maniacally as they did anything but the assigned exercise. Figures.</p>
<p>She had a medical exemption, but she loathed it with every fiber of her being. To be so <em>weak</em>, so feeble. It felt <em>awful.</em></p>
<p>The sun felt relentless on her chalk-hue skin, so she hid under a nearby oak and tried to enjoy the breeze as best she can.</p>
<p>She watched Sayaka antagonize the green hair girl, the tomboy filling in the gap that her name was Hitomi. Sayaka raced towards her, the moss-toned girl running away with as much grace and poise mortal fear afforded her (apparently quite a bit). Homura just smiled weakly. Calculated, familiar, pacifying.</p>
<p>Her classmates had finished warming up, students taking to ad-hoc activities in the stupefying Mitakihara “open ended classroom” strategy. It was allegedly European, but Homura had certainly never heard of such a thing.</p>
<p>Sayaka took the chance to do hurdles and cleared them with ease. Maybe she was a gymnast?</p>
<p><em>Maybe I get to keep friends this time. Maybe they won’t abandon me like…</em></p>
<p>Homura jolted awake, the sound of shattering glass in her ears as she found herself staring at a pair of gangly legs and shorts.</p>
<p>“Heya Akemi-san!” beamed Sayaka, looming over her.</p>
<p>When <em>did</em> she have the time to sneak up on her? Surely she wasn’t—</p>
<p>The rest of the class had gone inside. Their gym teacher was standing in the doorway, tapping the foot not propping the door open, irate. She had <em>fallen asleep</em>, hadn’t she?</p>
<p>Sayaka reached down a hand and dragged Homura to her feet, not letting go of her hand as they headed back for the interior of the building.</p>
<p>“Sorry…” she squeaked out, Sayaka refusing to even dignify a response.</p>
<p><em>Did she care that much, really?</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The rest of the day finished without interruption. Saotome-sensei had given her a mercy and let her skip some of her missed homework assignments in the run-up to the exam. She’d even let her copy from the examination booklet.</p>
<p>The less-than-ideal portion of this mercy was an immense burden. She had informed Homura that she was expected to pass the major exams from earlier in the year at a much higher interval.</p>
<p>Homura had agreed without a moment of fuss; if she wasn’t good at academics, what <em>was</em> she good at?</p>
<p>She continued the laborious walk across Mitakihara from the middle school to her warded home. Sure, it was out of the way, sure it wasn’t something she <em>chose</em>, but it was in a quiet part of town, and it was <em>expansive</em>.</p>
<p>Shame it never felt <em>lived in</em> though.</p>
<p>She unlocked the door and found herself staring at dusty furniture covered in tarps. She collapsed into the single uncovered loveseat, flicking back on a reading lamp that still had visible fingerprints from when she had turned it on the night prior.</p>
<p>The single incandescent lamp was warm, even when she felt cold, so cold. The nurses had assured her the chills would fade with time, and she prayed they were right. The alternative was too much to bear.</p>
<p>She sighed only once before opening her schoolbag, withdrawing a ratty school-issue copy of the assigned text.</p>
<p>Wasn’t this supposed to be dense for academics in post-secondary? Why were a group of middle schoolers assigned it?</p>
<p>At least it was annotated…</p>
<p>As Homura descended into her assignment, the textual bargain fresh in her mind, she failed to hear the sound of shattered glass somewhere on the street below.</p>
<hr />
<p>The lamp clicked off, and she crawled into bed. she folded her glasses carefully and put them at her side. Maybe she’d have good dreams this time.</p>
<hr />
<p>She was woken up by the sound of a scream, something outside. Homura’s eyes jerked open, laying in bed.</p>
<p>Surely it’s a hallucination. Surely it’s not real. Nothing ever <em>happens</em> in this part of town anyways.</p>
<p>She hears an explosion and the groan of metal scraping against metal. She bolts out of bed and stumbled over to the curtains, ripping them open.</p>
<p>She found herself face to face with her classmate riding on musical notes.</p>
<p>“Ah shit.” Sayaka mumbled, Homura suddenly red in the face at her attire.</p>
<p>“Miki-san, this dream…”</p>
<p>“Not a dream Akemi. Get back to sleep before the nightmare gets worse.”</p>
<p>Homura nodded instinctively, and receded from the window as another volley of something explosive careened past Sayaka, the street below covered in scorch marks.</p>
<p><em>Right, dream logic. Of course I dream she’s a magical girl.</em></p>
<p>Homura descended into the loveseat, closed her eyes and began to count down.</p>
<p><em>Ten, nine, eight.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka winced as the barrage of bullets tore through her cape. She had <em>just</em> spent time fixing it, <em>really!?</em></p>
<p><em>Seven, six, five.</em></p>
<p>A golden figure swung by the window suspended on sunbeam-hued threads. Perfectly retained curls didn’t loosen even slightly as she continued her assault on the magical girl.</p>
<p><em>Four, three.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka swung her shredded cape, pull on her self as she materialized a pile of sabres, launching one after the other at her aggressor. Mami did the same, Sayaka ripping her cape off as the magic ammunition harmlessly dispersed on contact with the accessory. Sayaka huddled around the corner of the alleyway, shivering in fear as Mami steadied her hand.</p>
<p><em>Two, one.</em></p>
<p>Mami raised the musket only slightly, to her skull, no, to her navel, her finger glancing on the trigger.</p>
<p>The clock chimed as Mami’s musket dematerialized, her outfit dissolving back into school attire. Sayaka’s fortissimo reverted to an otherwise mundane hairclip set, her skirt returning to a tacky plaid. Mami looked down in disappointment at the collapsed schoolgirl, before walking back into the night.</p>
<p>Sayaka peeked back in to Homura’s window and found the girl fast asleep in the loveseat. She gently stepped in through the still open window, draped her blanket across the girl, and left the same way she entered.</p>
<hr />
<p>Homura woke up to the sound of cicadas creeping in through her slightly ajar window.</p>
<p><em>Had</em> she left her window open the night prior? She really wasn’t sure. She knew the windows at the hospital hadn’t opened even slightly, the implications more than obvious when it got bad.</p>
<p>She banished the thought, and grabbed her glasses. Her hands were shaky as she unfolded the arms, gently placing them onto her face. She reached further off the side of her bed, grabbing her medication and a glass she had set out the night prior. </p>
<p>Homura swung her head back as she downed the pills, routine taking over as she let her thoughts wander. </p>
<p><em>What a strange dream, Miki-san from school… a magical girl. And a stranger shooting at her, an attempt on her life? Why would I dream of something so fantastic?</em></p>
<p>She carefully ran her fingers through her hair, brushing slowly as she ensured no such resistance remained in her nearly waist-length hair.</p>
<p><em>Dreams are just dreams. Nothing more. You know this Homura.</em></p>
<p>She slid a beaded hairtie over the end of a braid, the purple perfectly complimenting her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Surely if she was a magical girl, she wouldn’t have picked me as a friend.</em></p>
<p>She wasn’t sure she believed herself, but the barrage of thoughts continued unabated.</p>
<p><em>Well, if we’re friends, I’d hope she’d tell me if she was… Right?</em></p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p><em>But I have only been her classmate for a week. It’d be premature, wouldn’t it?</em> </p>
<p>An impulsive thought ran through her. Immature, stupid, boorish.</p>
<p>Why not simply ask Hitomi? Easy way to dispel such a strange dream, the girl had been her friend for <em>years</em>.</p>
<p>If anyone would know, it would be her.</p>
<hr />
<p>Homura walked into glass with the elegance of a nervous cat, sitting down in her seat before allowing herself to relax, even slightly.</p>
<p>She glanced back at Hitomi.</p>
<p><em>It’ll be easy. Just go up and ask.</em></p>
<p>Hitomi arrived well before her, her attention engrossed into a pocket compact as applied her makeup.</p>
<p><em>She’s doing her makeup? Since when did—</em></p>
<p>Homura ran her fingers through her hair, or rather, tried to. She had forgotten she braided her hair this morning <em>somehow</em>. Unable to cope with such a tragic and significant error in her self-image, she visibly cringed before she was even able to catch herself.</p>
<p><em>That probably looked so dumb…</em></p>
<p>“Homura-chan!” Hitomi smiled. Placid, elegant, sensible. She didn’t comment on her mistake, because of course she didn’t. That was the type of girl she was.</p>
<p>“Shizuki-san, I—” she stopped, the words dead on her lips as she processed what her classmate had said.</p>
<p>“You called me Homura-chan.”</p>
<p>“We’re friends, aren’t we?” she beamed. Homura felt her cheeks redden. Was this <em>really</em> the way to start this conversation? As if!</p>
<p>Homura took a breath, and fiddled with the trim of her skirt, nervously.</p>
<p>“I need to ask you something about Miki-san… Something. That might feel a little silly.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Gossiping are we?” Hitomi asked cattily.</p>
<p>Homura shook her head, nervously.</p>
<p>“No, n-not something like that. I had a really strange dream and was wondering if <em>she’s a magical girl</em>” she muttered, her voice trailing off at the end.</p>
<p>Hitomi tilted her head slightly, confused. She snapped her compact shut and shoved it back into her schoolbag, her attention fully on Homura.</p>
<p>“Repeat yourself, please. I want to make sure I heard you right.”</p>
<p>She beckoned Homura closer, the girls scarcely a meter apart. Hitomi’s voice was a whisper.</p>
<p>“You heard she’s a magical girl?”</p>
<p>“I… had a dream she was.”</p>
<p>Hitomi receded into her desk, the placating smile wiped from her face for a moment, being replaced with sheer terror, before returning to her resting mask.</p>
<p>She simply nodded.</p>
<p>Homura’s jaw hung open. She had expected to be shut down, her classmate to ridicule her, to be made the laughing stock of. Instead, she was <em>entertaining her delusions!</em></p>
<p>What type of city <em>was</em> Mitakihara‽</p>
<p>“Oh, Hitomi-chan! Homura-chan!” chimed Sayaka from the door, Homura jumping at the sound of her voice.</p>
<p><em>Speak of the devil…</em></p>
<p>“Sayaka-chan, Homura-chan just asked me quite an uncommon question.” Hitomi mused, Homura’s cheeks turning the color of a tomato.</p>
<p>“Oh, are you one of <em>us</em> Homura? Y’know…” she muttered, flapping her hand at the girl, Homura practically incandescent.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t asking i-if you were <em>single</em>, if that’s what you mean.”</p>
<p>Sayaka went from lackadaisical to a somewhat bored confusion, the tone turning more serious by the moment.</p>
<p>“What was it then, Akemi-san?”</p>
<p>“I was asking… if you were a magical girl.”</p>
<p>Sayaka’s face turned to dread horror.</p>
<p>“Never heard of ’em, before. sorry!” she grinned wildly, grabbing Homura and moving her back towards her desk.</p>
<p>“Sorry Miki-san, I had such a strange dream and I had to—”</p>
<p>“Stop talking about your dreams about me, it’s a little uncomfortable Akemi-san!” she yelped, finally releasing the girl at her assigned desk.</p>
<p>She had <em>dragged her</em> across the classroom without even breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Sayaka stomped back to her desk in the back of the room next to Hitomi, shot her a knowing glance, and kicked her feet up. She had to get her relaxation in before their tyrannical dictator entered.</p>
<p>A voice rang out in Homura’s head, one she had heard only moments prior, singing a very different tune.</p>
<p><em>Don’t talk about that too loudly. She’ll hear.</em></p>
<p>Homura’s head spun wildly, looking around the room for the source. Sayaka-chan was still at her desk, feet up on it. She looked at Homura, raising an eyebrow as she ran her fingers through her chopped short hair.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Telepathy. Magical girls are real. Don’t talk about it in the open though, ya idiot!</em></p>
<p>Homura felt a sense of dread wash over her, inexplicable. Why would magical girls ever be a bad thing? The train of thought derailed rather quickly though, when she felt a presence looming on the off-side of her desk, right outside of her field of vision.</p>
<p>Her head swiveled around as she found herself staring at a girl with pink hair and two pigtails, done up in ribbons. Her uniform was, well, uniform, spare a glittering earcuff dangling off the side.</p>
<p><em>Curious.</em></p>
<p>“Ah, you must be the transfer student.” she smiled.</p>
<p>“Akemi Homura.” she said, managing to not stutter for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>“I’m-” the girl began, Sayaka <em>appearing</em> behind Homura in an instant.</p>
<p>“Kaname Madoka.” she said, her voice steeled, her fists closed as she trembled.</p>
<p>She carried the same dignified poise that Hitomi seemed to, only punctuated by something… something else in the undertone. A fractional smirk, a stray lingering glance.</p>
<p>She was dissecting her. </p>
<p>“Oh, Sayaka-chan. I see you’ve already made friends. How <em>fun!</em>” she smiled, her voice dripping with venom.</p>
<p>Her attention returned to the transfer student.</p>
<p>“I’m Kaname Madoka, Homura-chan. I’m the health officer for our class. Saotome-sensei told me that you may have need of my help, so if you need anything, <em>anything at all</em>, don’t hesitate to ask.”</p>
<p>Homura shuddered, she couldn’t explain it. She was being quite kind, but Sayaka’s instantaneous opposition felt so strange.</p>
<p>Why couldn’t they just be friends?</p>
<p>“Of course, Kaname-san.”</p>
<p>Kaname Madoka looked at her, up and down, as if waiting for something. What in particular, Homura had no idea.</p>
<p>“We’re classmates, Homura-chan. Call me Madoka!”</p>
<p>Homura <em>shivered</em>, unsure why the otherwise cordial girl had caused such a reaction.</p>
<p>“In time, I think.” she sheepishly mumbled, the interloper receded back to her desk on the far side of the room.</p>
<p>Homura pulled out her class notebook and began flipping through the pages, struggling to dispel the creeping doubt that something else was going on.</p>
<p>She felt Sayaka’s hand on her shoulder, jumping slightly at the contact.</p>
<p><em>That’s her.</em></p>
<p>Homura’s blood ran cold. <em>Her?</em></p>
<p><em>Her.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Lunch was as uneventful as it could be, finding out your classmate was a magical girl, and another was… something else?</p>
<p>Miki-san still refused to explain more.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be getting mixed up in all of this Akemi-san. It’s… not good for you.” she said, gesturing downwards at her chest.</p>
<p>Homura had almost forgotten for a moment that under her uniform she still bore the literal and metaphorical scars of being in a hospital for much of the past year. Was there even a place for her in a world of magical girls with such an obvious flaw?</p>
<p>“Ah, my heart.”</p>
<p>Sayaka didn’t respond, she just tilted her head, hesitating to look her in the eye.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Given that and about a million other things? Don’t <em>join the team</em> if you don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“Even as a <em>cheerleader?</em>” Homura asked, not quite clawing at desperation yet, but scrabbling at it.</p>
<p>“<em>Especially</em> not as a cheerleader. I don’t think it’s good for you to be so close to the <em>game</em>.”</p>
<p>Homura nodded, downtrodden.</p>
<p>“Is Hitomi on that <em>sports team</em> with you?”</p>
<p>She glanced across the bench at the girl, eating what looked like a professionally packed bento. She had just a pang of jealously mixed in with the chikuwa. </p>
<p><em>It wouldn’t be right for her to be a magical girl.</em></p>
<p>“Ah, nah. It isn’t her game, really. She’s still supportive when it comes down to it.”</p>
<p>Hitomi simply smiled.</p>
<p>“Not all of us can be <em>star athletes</em> like Sayaka-chan here.”</p>
<p>Sayaka turned a shade of beeroot for a moment before gesturing back down at their lunches.</p>
<p><em>So… Kaname-san?</em></p>
<p>Sayaka glanced around the rooftop atrium for a moment, before letting her gaze settle on her peer.</p>
<p><em>What about her?</em></p>
<p><em>What… happened to her?</em></p>
<p>Sayaka paused, hesitating in her response.</p>
<p><em>Is it time for her to know?</em></p>
<p><em>No, not yet.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka shrugged at Homura.</p>
<p><em>We used to be friends when we were younger. Magical girl stuff… wasn’t good for either of us.</em></p>
<p>Homura’s jaw hung agape.</p>
<p><em>She’s a magical girl too!?</em></p>
<p>“Uh. She used to be.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Sayaka only shook her head.</p>
<p>“Not today, please.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow then?”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Lunch ended too quickly as Homura made her way back down the labyrinth that was the school’s design. She had heard through the rumor mill it was inspired by something European, maybe American? A prison in either case, a maze all the same.</p>
<p>She found herself crossing a bridge between the east and west wings when she heard a voice behind her.</p>
<p>“Homura-chan.” the voice rang out, pink hair and white ribbons looking at her.</p>
<p>“Kaname-san.” Homura responded. Cold, curt. Miki-san had made it clear she should <em>respect</em> her at a minimum, but not to give an inch.</p>
<p>“Oh Akemi-san… My dearest sworn enemy. My dove.” </p>
<p>“Enemies?”</p>
<p>Homura wasn’t sure she believed it. She was too new to make enemies, much less with the <em>health officer!</em> What if she got hurt or sick?</p>
<p>“Of course. It isn’t like you’d <em>remember</em> though… Or perhaps you might remember it like a bad dream. I certainly did back when this was reaching it’s first terminus.”</p>
<p>Was she seriously <em>monologuing?</em> What type of middle-schooler monologues to the brand new tranfer student!</p>
<p>“A dream?”</p>
<p>“A dream, yes.”</p>
<p>Homura felt <em>something</em> in the back of her mind, gears turning as the familiar figure changed for a moment, gold eyes turned pink, pink eyes turned crimson.</p>
<p>“Who am I to you?” Homura whispered, wringing her hands as a smile crept across Kaname-san’s face, her weary eyes lighting up for just a moment; recognition.</p>
<p>“I care about you. Know that if nothing else.”</p>
<p>Homura was beside herself. This girl was acting…oh what’s the word… Chunnibyo! Strange, offputting! Like a villainess!</p>
<p>And somehow, deep in her heart, she knew that wasn’t how this girl was meant to act.</p>
<p>“Kaname-san… what happened to you?” Homura asked, the weight of memories she was unburdened by pounding on her skull with the intensity of a thousand suns.</p>
<p>“You did, Homura-chan. Always you.”</p>
<p>Homura’s mind split open for a single second, frozen between two ticks of the clock as countless memories flooded back. Her rebellion, a plunged black dress, a confessional of love, her descent into madness, an impostor wearing her face…</p>
<p>And then it was gone, just as quickly.</p>
<p>“Silly Homura-chan. Those memories aren’t for you.” she beamed, tapping her own head gently.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep them safe for you, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Madoka….”</p>
<p>“We’ll become enemies one day, my dear. Until then? You won’t remember.”</p>
<p>“I… I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“You will. Just not today.”</p>
<p>The strange girl left, Homura beside herself as she looked down at her hands.</p>
<p>When <em>had</em> that ring gotten there?</p>
<hr />
<p>Homura was shaken. Emotionally, physically, cognitively. So much of what happened was at odds with…. well… everything. This <em>wasn’t</em> how the world worked. Magic and strange happenings and her classmate being her self-proclaimed enemy?</p>
<p><em>It could still be delusion. The nurses did warn me that there were side effects to the anti-rejection medications. Maybe I haven’t eaten enough? Or had enough water?</em></p>
<p>Homura sat down at her desk, finding a note folded on her desk.</p>
<p><em>Of course, the circus continues.</em></p>
<p>“Akemi-kami,”</p>
<p>Homura blinked, the first line sending her reeling. It mustn’t be for her, the writer must have lost their mind (poor thing). And yet, <em>and yet</em>, she kept reading.</p>
<p>“There was a time when your other half could look you in the eye, to beg for forgiveness or for a mercy of absolution.</p>
<p>That time has come and gone, a martyr made of the devil, and a fallen angel crafted from a bittersweet agony.</p>
<p>When you seek to know the truth about Kaname Madoka, find me where you found her.</p>
<p>Your loyal matchmaker, Nagisa Momoe”</p>
<p>That was <em>not</em> who she expected a letter from; who even <em>was</em> Nagisa Momoe? Was there something in the water condemning the students of Mitakihara Middle to these chuunibiyo delusions? What other explanation could there be?</p>
<p>Homura stared at her hands, trembling as she processed the past twenty four hours.</p>
<p>She had strange dreams where Miki Sayaka, the tomboy who sat towards the back of the room, was a magical girl fighting some other magical girl she didn’t know.</p>
<p>Then why did she seem so familiar?</p>
<p>Another of her classmates, a pink-haired chuunibyo named Kaname Madoka had declared her her enemy, and… something else had happened? The more she tried to focus on that moment, on what had happened, the fuzzier it got.</p>
<p>Then there was the matter of Hitomi-chan, the ojou-sama of the Shizuki matriarchy, entertaining both her line of questioning about magical girls with nervous anticipation <em>and</em> not shutting it down.</p>
<p>All of that would be quite explainable as her needing to return to Satomi Medical with speed and urgency. A psychological break from the burden of returning to school with little institutional support.</p>
<p>She could practically <em>hear</em> the diagnostic codes during her admission to the psychiatric ward already. Another piece of errata in a litany of pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, two occurrences remained persistent, stubborn, steadfast; unwilling to be dispelled so easily.</p>
<p>The strange ring that appeared on her middle finger of her left hand without a second thought… and only after her strange conversation on the sky bridge. She took it off, inspecting the purple gemstone in it, matching her eyes perfectly.</p>
<p>When she held it up to the light, she swore it glittered pink.</p>
<p>And then there was the telepathy. Repeated, intentional conversations that carried language when she <em>knew</em> Sayaka-chan wasn’t speaking aloud.</p>
<p>Could she really dismiss the telepathy? Could she bury the ring, the dreams, the strange speech? Could she <em>really</em> forget all of this and just be an ordinary (somewhat pathetic) transfer student?</p>
<p>The weary look on Kaname-san’s face lingered in her mind. She declared her an enemy once she remembered; remembered <em>what</em>? She seemed so <em>sad</em> in saying so… did she really mean that?</p>
<p>And worst of yet, it all felt so real, so <em>familiar</em>. It wasn’t just some rumor, some absurdity. It was as real as sunshine, and <em>that</em> was what scared her.</p>
<p>She shook her head as Saotome-sensei re-entered the room, still visibly upset over the last conversation with her boyfriend-of-the-week.</p>
<p>Nakazawa groaned, knowing he’d be the target of her ire come lesson-time again.</p>
<p>The faintest shape of a smile flickered across Homura’s face. At least <em>this</em> part was familiar and <em>normal</em>.</p>
