<p>Some nacent part of Homura’s psyche realized in that moment that some of her memories had been returned. More alarmingly, was the ones still missing.</p>
<p>She recalled Madoka departing their world, and ugly-crying on a train station platform.</p>
<p>She remembered Sayaka’s death, birthing the witch Oktavia von Seckendorff… and yet the girl sat across from her, as if a concerned family member.</p>
<p><em>One oddity at a time.</em></p>
<p>“What happened to me, Miki-san?”</p>
<p>“You passed out on the field. Nurse said you were dehydrated.”</p>
<p>Homura glared at Tomoe Mami, running her fingers through her hair as if by rote memorization. It <em>had</em> been her impulse for a decade plus, after all.</p>
<p>“I’m aware of <em>that part</em>, Miki-san. I heard the nurse. What happened in <em>here</em>?”</p>
<p>Sayaka awkwardly shuffled in her seat, not sure how to describe Kaname Madoka, <em>a devil</em>, to her most devout follower.</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Lady Kaname healed you.” Mami spoke confidently, with an ego commensurate with a high priestess.</p>
<p>Of <em>course</em> she would regard herself as such; pretender.</p>
<p>Sayaka leapt to her feet in an instant. “Oh fuck <em>off</em>, <em>I</em> healed her. All”Lady Kaname” did was help with the broken buckler.”</p>
<p>“My buckler?” Homura murmured, materializing her magical girl regalia in an instant, looking down to find her buckler conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>“Yeah uh… you heard Madoka’s name and vomited up the sand from the shield…”</p>
<p>Homura’s face flashed with fear, her mind run amock.</p>
<p><em>I can’t redo this, I can’t rewind this, I cannot go forward with no way back-</em></p>
<p>“Hey, hey, hey, hey. Homura. Hey. Look at me. We’ll be <em>okay</em>, okay?”</p>
<p>Homura didn’t hear her, arms shaking as she gripped her forearm as if it would miraculously return her primary weapon. Oilstains dripped at the ground around her, Sayaka’s eyes flitting to the ground, some instinctual part of her mind recognizing the tell-tale pitch of despair.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was the mounting chanting of the Clara dolls, the drumming of <em>Gott ist tot</em> grabbing at her heart.</p>
<p>“Akemi-san, please. Pull yourself together. Our Lady Kaname expects you to make a full recovery.”</p>
<p>Homura <em>still</em> didn’t hear her, the mechanical ticking of a clock grinding in her ears, irrepressable, the faintest threads of spiderweb creeping out of her eyes and rising skywards.</p>
<p>Mami fashioned a musket from her ribbon, sighed, and fired her musket, once, twice, the shot erupting mere inches from Homura’s ear.</p>
<p>In an instant, the scarlet spiderweb dissolved, the chanting halted, the oil slick waned. In their place was a readied Homura, levying a pistol at Tomoe Mami, aimed right at the blossom in her cap. </p>
<p>“Don’t.” she barked, Mami-san dissolving her musket as Homura glanced down at her still shaking hands.</p>
<p>“Where the hell did you get that <em>gun</em>, Homura?”</p>
<p>“I don’t-” she began, inspecting the grip. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“What do you <em>mean</em>, you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“It’s clearly a 1911, but the design on the grip? Yellow flowers? That’s very clearly Tomoe-san’s motif.”</p>
<p>“It’s certainly not <em>my</em> gun, that’s for sure. You <em>must</em> be confusing me for someone else.” she scoffed, somehow forgetting that she discharged a musket in the nurse’s office, Homura mere moments from returning fire.</p>
<p>Homura glanced knowingly at Sayaka, the magical girl made more knowing damn well Homura didn’t want to wear her heart on her sleeve for the commondant of the hour.</p>
<p><em>It’s from a very early loop. A memento.</em></p>
<p>Sayaka peered down at the floor, the oilstains surrounding Homura’s cot having vanished as quickly as they’d arrived. <em>Phew.</em></p>
<p>“Okay well, that’s a neat new-” Sayaka began, the sentence derailed as she saw Mami had raised a single closed fist.</p>
<p>They looked at her, indignant. Since when was she a damned <em>field marshal</em>?</p>
<p>“Are both of you so <em>insensitive</em> to your own soul gems as to not notice something manifesting itself?”</p>
<p>“A wraith?”</p>
<p>“Ever the genius, Miki-san.” Mami prattled, Sayaka rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>Homura wasn’t so sure. She played back the last several days of her life, menial homework (though she wouldn’t say as much at the time), decent moments with her friends Hitomi and Sayaka… familiar and discomforting experiences like beginning to pass out again. All of it stacked up to an inevitable question. One she was flabbergasted that Sayaka didn’t seem to be asking.</p>
<p>“Where is Sakura Kyoko?”</p>
