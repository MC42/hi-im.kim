Eugene's office door was closed. A far cry from the "open door policy" that had made him such an effective researcher and colleague, but compromises were the only way *that* happened anyways.  In the interceding months since his rapid and unplanned disassembly at the hands of his most important *project*...

He was lost.  He was so fucking lost.

Month 1, Personal Diary

I figured it's a good idea to write down my thoughts.  The action helps memory function, and my memory is the most important thing I have.  Sure, arcana matters, but if I can't remember... what am I doing it for?

Month 2, Personal Diary

Anastasia started sleeping in the guest bedroom.  I can't blame her when I toss and turn every night.  Restless is an understatement, I'm fairly sure my eyes looked less red when I was in undergrad.  I'm hoping I can return to the bedroom before too long.

Month 3, Personal Diary (Section Removed)

NO NO NO PLEASE NO NO NO NO PLEASE NO NO NO NO PLEASE NO NO NO NO PLEASE NO NO NO NO FUCK NO FUCK YOU FUCK THIS

WHY DID YOU HAVE To SHOW ME, I COULD HAVE BEEN IGNORANT.

Month 3, Personal Diary (Loosely included)

The nightmares are back.  I can hear her when I'm sleeping, the, uh... the call of it.  The call of the wild?  No, that's not it.

It's not for me, it's not my *calling* and yet I can still hear her.

I only knew her in passing, and I want so badly to know her again.  Even the agony was comforting.

Month 4, Psychiatric Wing Notes (Annalise Chapel, R.N.)

Eugene's state has been steadily improving with use of antipsychotics to the point he's been permitted back into his old laboratory.  Many colleagues, despite assurances from the executive committee, treat him as a glass cannon.  Sam Groves was quoted saying that "he's cuckoo, a damned liability in the lab".  

While he's still visibly struggling with this image adjustment, further adjustment is outside the scope of professional responsibility and personal jurisprudence.

What else is there to do?

Month 8, Personal Diary

I lost my job.  To say witches cost me my job would be inaccurate.  

They disassembled me, they killed a version of me that commit heinous acts.  And that version of me had to die, I won't deny that.  I felt it.

TThe more damning part of it, the part that I doubt they wanted for me, left me... close to magic.  When your very being is woven at a sub-spatial level to keep you alive while in chunks of disparate meat, you see things.

Things that aren't explainable otherwise.

I was approaching the problem all wrong.  Figures.  I studied Mechatronics, not magic! There's no degree in Arcana from Miskatonic U!  

Magic isn't science, even if it's sufficiently advanced at other points.  I need to remove variables, to understand it holistically.

So I brought the consultant back, personally financed.  I'll learn.

Month 11, Personal Diary

I fucking hate this.  The estrogen was hardly recreational at this point, but it did bring the dreams back.  They're more vivid now, acute depictions of what it was like when... disassembled.  I know I hate this, but I still find myself compelled to take the pills.  

At least my skin is softer.

Month 12, Personal Diary

Well, Anastasia noticed finally.  She was, needless to say, worried.  About me, about us.  She's staying with her parents for a few months while I "figure things out."

She didn't see the flickering point of light I made to show her.  One door closes...

Month 14, Work Journal

I was hired as adjunct faculty at the [school] where the impromptu coven was originally.  Most of them have graduated, the ones that remain seem to not recognize me.  I don't either.  In passing, I heard something she said, about my being uncanny and chilling.

Part of me felt proud.  Was it *actually my feelings*?  Or was it just... the effect of magic?  Do I get to separate the two?  What happened to a control?
