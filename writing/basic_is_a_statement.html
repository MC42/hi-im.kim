<h2>The Web Is Opinionated</h2>
</header>
<p>
    Regardless of how much someone might <i>want</i> to use sites written in gobs and heaps of Javascript transpiled webassembly, you inevitably <i>will</i>.  This is not an accident, this is an intentional choice.
</p>
<p>A designer, a programmer, a <a href="https://www.kushcreates.com/blogs/why-vibe-coding-makes-me-want-to-throw-up">vibe programmer</a> decided that, yes, for money or time, we <i>should</i> use a toolkit that is predecated on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident?useskin=vector">someone else's fight</a> not interfering with using said tool.</p>
<p>
    Is this what the end user might want?  That doesn't truly matter, not with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern?useskin=vector">dark pattern</a> that continuously disrespects what their intents are. After all, sites are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot?useskin=vector">emphemeral</a> and both can and <i>will</i> vanish regardless of the user wants.
</p>
<p>
    We're in for an eternity of consent dialogues that misunderstand consent, countless clicks of 
    <code>
        [ Not Now ]</b>
    </code>
    that might <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/not-now-a91c75ad35b6?gi=f3097301284b"> never go away.</a>  
</p>

<p>
    Maybe if I'm not so cynical though, I'd point out that in small circles, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring?useskin=vector">web ring</a> never died. 
</p>
    <p>
    Human-centric design still an intentional act of creation turned into obligation by every byte transferred. 
     Maybe we can mourn websites that were beloved in their time and might never come back, CSS hacks spewed into 
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohost?useskin=vector">Cohost's</a> void with joyous intent.
    </p>

<p>
    It's okay to make bad websites, it's wonderful to make <i>silly</i> websites!  And sometimes, maybe sometimes, 
    the right move is still to make something the same way you did when you were younger.
</p>
<p>Maybe re-enacting your first fight with <code>vim</code> will bring back that childish whimsy of a web that was
     bold and fresh, optimistic and open, huh? Sorry, I'll try to dial back the cynicism.</p>

<p>
    Or maybe it's time to run <code>rm -rf / --no-preserve-root</code> and wipe the slate clean.  Sheep farming seems ideal, right?
</p>
<p>Oh, look, more npm updates <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58972251/what-does-x-packages-are-looking-for-funding-mean-when-running-npm-install">asking for donations.</a></p>
