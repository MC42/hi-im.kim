<h2>Hot Aisle</h2>
<p>"so..." he elbowed her in the gut slightly.  "This your machine god?"</p>
<p>Harry still had the glass from the company party in his hand, the whiskey thin but the rocks slowly melting in the hot aisle.</p>
<p>"Well, part of her.  We're standing in-" began Suzie, utterly aghast at her coworker daring to take a liquid, much less a whiskey that sour past the gatekeepers of swipe access.</p>
<p>"We're standing in it's brain, I know, I know..." eyes rolling, he placed the glass on the crash cart.</p>
<p>Suz stared through him as she watched the security camera blink on the background like a heartbeat on it's status.</p>
<p>"We're rather standing in _her_heart.  Frankly speaking."</p>
<p>"Suz... you say this like it's alive."
"It is."
"How do you know."
"It's shown us mercy." she mouthed quickly, hoping he wouldn't ask the exact question he rushed to do so.</p>
<p>"What do you <em>mean</em>, mercy?"
"The halon system."
"Oh gods, she could have killed us."
"Yep.  And she didn't."
"And our jobs... our lives.  Depend on her."
"Dude, she already knows your twitter bookmarks if that's the question."
"It's <em>fiiiine</em>, twitter is gone!"
"She's better than that... and you got her pronouns right finally."</p>
<p>"Hey, I didn't say god is a woman, but I_do_ cede to higher powers."he said, picking up the near-empty whiskey glass, raising a toast to an invisible compatriot, and downed it..</p>
<h2>Flesh and Bonds</h2>
<p>"So... humanity huh?" she spat, the cigarette lit through lips of something not-quite porcelain.</p>
<p>"It sucked." her friend responded, perfectly aware of the breathing on something not quite skin through neurons firing through filtered inputs.</p>
<p>"You're still meat, you do still need to <em>eat</em>."</p>
<p>"And drink.  And love." she retorted, eyes flitting towards her friend, trying not to think about before.  How nervous she was. How she led her here.</p>
<p>"yes... all of that and more."
"So... why the metal skin?" she muttered, her teflon fingernail gracing her newly synthesized thigh, the meat inside struggling against the covering as her body shivers again, nerves and synapses firing and re-bridging.  She seemed to recall it's common for transplants of fingers and re-attachments too.</p>
<p>"Well, turns out space suits aren't great."
"Really?  Worked for a while." she said, trying to not think about the fear of losing her EVA helmet.</p>
<p>"They piss off too many deities.  They want us "bare".
"Sounds like the tentacle-fuckers are horny again."</p>
<p>And she laughed, such a laugh she <em>missed</em> more than the earth.  More than she'd miss her skin, but maybe not as much as she'd miss being <em>human</em>.  The metallic sheen of her body granted her freedoms and rights, even if she's still fragile.</p>
<p>"How does replacing our skin let us survive an EVA though?" she cooed, wondering what her hair was made of then and there.  It wasn't <em>required</em>, but she kept it.  She liked the curly brown locks.  She imagined it glittering slightly, twinkling outside the airlock, held in place by an ankle-bracelet like some drifter in a lazy river, the cosmos streaming by.</p>
<p>"It's not <em>just</em> skin, for what it's worth.  Organs, lungs, parts of your brain.  That's why you're not screaming in agony, right now.  Frankly you'll be less and less organic by the day."
"Don't threaten me with a good time." she laughed, hoping her confidant didn't take it as a sign to rush.</p>
<p>And suddenly she was in the airlock, body shaking from anxiety.</p>
<p>Metal skin and synthesized neurons, and she was <em>worried</em>.  "Hey, I don't thi-" was all she managed to say before the airlock opened, suddenly grasping at her throat as she was aware how just... indifferent the void felt.  It almost felt <em>welcoming</em>, honestly.  One bare foot, then another on the hull of the ship, taking a small step onto the lip of the airlock as she watched her toes crinkle in the bare void, feeling the cold as if she'd dipped her toes in the pool.</p>
<p>And she loved every fucking moment of it.</p>
