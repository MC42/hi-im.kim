"How did you get here in-" she began, glancing at her watch, to find it not there, "like fourty minutes."  Her hair was disshelved, barely getting out of the shower.  Curls were beginning to form in the cool of the summer night, crickets so rudely interrupting their awkward silence.

"I drove fast?"

"That's like... 250 miles an hour fast." 

"You need to call your witch friend over, because I don't know how.  I just drove and got here, the roads at night all look the same.  I got on the saw mill parkway and turned off of the masspike... I think"  

"Fine, I'll call Julianna, but she's not gonna like being woken up."

Julianna was not asleep, and stumbled over to her apartment in sweats with a backpack (but not the same one as she sometimes brought over) and a haphazard hat covered in the dust of some chips.

"Wait you can fucking _wrongwarp?_"

---

"So I was driving on the saw mill parkway-" began Sarah

"Creepy road, poor lighting, lots of things watching you go?" glanced

"... yeah how'd you know?" Sarah responded, as Julianna plunged her arm into her back and pulled out a hair tie to put her hair up

Carlie interrupted before she had a chance to respond;  "Jul.... when was the last time you put your hair up?"

"That basement races I took you to."

"With the-"

"*Yes* the one with the subway broom races.  Still not proud of getting caught then by the provost's office."

Sarah almost thought to ask how the hell you had races in a basement, but she figured it was normal witch antics.  Her equivalent of a thirsty thursday.

"So.... pretty sure you're at least a little magic." she said, glancing at the girl as she gulped nervously.  

"Hey Carlie, is your new girlfriend-"

Carlie and Sarah both began blushing furiously.

"She's not-"

"We're not-" 

Both sputtered as Julianna dumped a bottle of something off-pink and glittery onto Sarah as she took on an absurd sheen, Carlie glowly dimly the same hue."

"Yeah, figured. Sapphic entanglement, a splash of magic, and cursed ecosystem."

"What, new york was so pissed at my yearning it tossed me into Massachusetts?"

"Have you _heard_ about how gay Mass is?  One time, I managed to warp from a Taco Bell in Virginia to one in Long Beach.  That one took a lot of explaining and at least two borrowed brooms."

"Two?"

"First one shattered over the radio quiet zone.  Turns out, some brooms do have a detectable resonant frequency and the enforcers don't like it."

---

"So... what do I do?  Can I prevent wrongwarping?"

"I mean, sure, if you want to learn witchcraft and specialize in subspatial bubbles."

"... isn't that the thing from Star Trek?"

"Oh thank fuck you're a _nerd_, that saves a lot of work." she said, slumping over the couch and throwing her legs on the arm of it.

"I mean... yeah?  I'm trans and have more hours on AO3 than I do in TF2, and both are high."

"Okay so... you can do it by gut feeling.  A lot of magic is.  Rules are for chumps anyways.  I know a girl if you have hormone issues at all, and/or if you want to do something satanic.  There's a dozen ways to deal with it, speaking from experience."

The look of embarrassment on Sarah's face had her turning different colors, barely able to keep herself calm.  The world had opened to her because she lesbian'd too hard, and now her not-quite-crush's ex was telling her how to cheat at transitioning?

"Uh.... can you teach me?"

"Here, what's your email.  I'll get you added to the polycule file server."

"You can't just add her, there are bylaws-"

"It's just the fileserver, and _just_ those docs Carlie. Frankly I expected you to send them to her already, I told you to share it with people you know who need it."

The tension could be cut with a knife, and that's when Carlie and Julianna both fell over as if pulled by an invisible force.

"Dear gods Sarah, you need to learn _fast_ or you're gonna take down an airliner with an imagination like that.  We're using the psyche.  Get some water, get the lights, and get your most comfortable PJs on.  We're going diving into your head."
