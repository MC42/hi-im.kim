# Flesh and Blood

She took a cursory twist of her wrist, trying to notice where it didn't quite fit before.

"Huh..."

"Well your arms are shorter, that's for sure."

"How much did you _undo_?"

"About a year."

"You fucking managed to suck out a year of testosterone exposure in an afternoon?"

"Yes, a very tiring one.." sputtered Jan, falling back into the rolling chair behind her.

"How?"

"Would you believe me if I said it was a hundred year old secret?"

"Won't I learn it eventually?"

With eyes that could have melted steel (and rather abruptly Minerva was afraid of the possibility) she responded quickly

"The key word is *eventually*."

As Minerva waddled to her feet, she realized not only that she was shorter, but that her shoes fit poorly.

"Holy shit, I need new clothes."

"Third floor, right stairwell, fourth door.  Old clothes pantry, should be something in there that fits you in that style."

"How do you know that so _well_?"

"Because that's where I put mine when I outgrew then, dorkass."

She ushered Minerva out the door with all the bravado of a parent escorting their kid back to school as Jen stared back.

"She blew threw most of my supplies _and_ I'm gonna be out of it for at least a week."

"Yeah, but given the little _demonstration_ she gave by accident in the garden saving Alicia, I have no doubt it'll be fine."
