<p>The wind whistled past her window, and she heard a nostalgic buzzer.  Rushing towards it, she shoved her head out the window, seeing a car passing down the nighttime street outside of her apartment.  With a dejected sigh, she pulled her head back in, meandering over towards the bookshelf, a lifetime of memorabilia decorating it.  Metal pucks with blue and red cords, more pins and buttons than any sensible person would have, and a book with a grey cover covered in sharpie, far too weathered to be made out by anyone who didn’t know it by heart.</p>

<p>Her hand brushed against the cover, and memories of robotics, the days long since gone by, the cheers, the energy, all came back in an instant.  The match announcer screamed “3, 2, 1, GO!” as her phone began to ring, breaking her out of her trance.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Liu, this is Principal Marcus Hanley of the Glen Cove School District.  You’ve been approved as our new Faculty Advisor.” the deep voice boomed, cracking the tinny speakers of her phone.  “When can you start?”</p>

<p>“I can start tomorrow if that works for you.” she smiled faintly, gently touching the medals on her shelf nearby, wiping the dust off of one.  “And Mrs. Liu?” the voice boomed.</p>
<br>“Yes?”
<p>“Your resume listed experience with competition robotics, is that correct?” the voice asked, but she was already a thousand miles away.  The cheers, buzzers, the sounds of people yelling “robot” overtook her, barely squeaking out a “yes”.</p>

<p>“Would you be willing to mentor our FIRST team?  They’re a scrappy bunch, but I’m sure they’ll make you feel right at home.” he laughed.</p>

<p>“See you tomorrow for training.” he said, and hung up, the phone hanging limply in her hands.</p>

<i>I’m back.  I can teach robots, I can go to competition again.  I can be myself again!</i>

<p>With a bounce in her step, she grabbed the copy of “The New Cool” off the shelf, and settled into the couch for the evening, tomorrow was a new day, for herself and for her new team.</p>
