<h1>Mangling Subtitles For Fun and No Profit<h1>

<p><i>I spend some time trying to better explain workflow(s) for using subtitles in video editing.</i></p>
<!-- Opener / What *are* Subtitles Anyways? -->

<h2 id="ch_1">
What <i>are</i> subtitles anyways?
</h2>

<p>Subtitles are the wonderful, fantastic tool that allows text to be shown in a video or livestream to explain what's going on.  While they don't always, they can indicate the speaker, emphasis on certain words, pauses, and most importantly, markup.</p>
<!-- Subtitles -->

    <div class="image-container"><i>The "Technology Connections" channel very specifcally makes use of subtitles on YouTube.</i></div>

<p>Historically, formats like the .ASS file format only included very limited markup capability, only including a few XHTML tags that enabled colors, bold, italics, and underline.  Some modifications even enabled the use of <i>intentional positioning</i>, which is really cool, but that was then and this is now.</p>
<p>Modern subtitle containers allow you to do some pretty wild stuff, beyond just positioning and location.  During a viewing of  <i>Shoujo Kagegi Revue Starlight</i>, the use of both Japanese and English characters co-mingle on the screen.  Some of the text is video, some of it is subtitles; can you guess which is which?</p>

    <div class="image-container">
      <script>
        function swap_revue() {
          var source_1 = "img/revue_ep5_1.png";
          var source_2 = "img/revue_ep5_2.png";

          if (document.getElementById("revue_swapme").src.includes(source_1) ) {
            console.log("same id");
            document.getElementById("revue_swapme").src = source_2;
          } else {
            document.getElementById("revue_swapme").src = source_1;
            console.log("oopsie");
          }

        }
      </script>
        <!-- Image goes here. -->
      <img id="revue_swapme" src="img/revue_ep5_1.png">

    <div class="image-container"><i><button onclick="swap_revue()">Click</button> to swap images and test your guess!</i></div>

<p>With the presumption of a cynical reader, you might be shocked to find out that subtitlers are afforded the option to set the kerning, as well as to use non-system fonts via container embedding.</p>

<p>Much in the same way that the <a href="https://github.com/incubated-geek-cc/pdf-font-extractor"> fonts embedded in a PDF can be extracted</a> though, the fonts inside an arbitrary video container can often be extracted.  Via some invocation of ffmpeg like described on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35270002/extracting-subtitles-from-mkv-using-ffmpeg">StackOverflow</a>, we can see that below.</p>

<code>
ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t "" -i input.mkv

<h2>Visual Effects</h2>

<p>While the usual gamut of a legible font with a discernable border to distinguish it from the surrounding graphics is commonplace, some subtitlers go the extra mile.  When depicting items on a screen, it's often that the edge of the "camera" in an anime is abberated, as the light hits the sensor slightly differently.  This too has been replicated by fansubbers, as seen <a href="https://fansubbers.miraheze.org/wiki/Guide:Chromatic_Aberration_(typesetting)">here</a> on the fansubbing wiki.</p>
