    <h2>Why Write Something Custom</h2>
</p>
<p>
    In short, the reason I went with something custom over something that existed was a desire for higher polish and integration of competitor experience.  it's easier to advocate for an institution when it feels they value you, and vice versa!  This was one way I could show that.

    <h2 id="whynotcustom">Why Not Use Custom Hardware / Electronics / PCBs</h2>
</p>

<p>
    <a href="gscrl.org">GSCRL</a> used to!  The previous solution was somewhat tedious and had a number of rough edges for both iteration <i>and</i> use.  The requirement to use an ESP32 with none of our volunteers having more than a passing interaction with C++, much less Arduino framework antics on an ESP32, left us in a rough spot when we needed to make changes or improvements to the timer (remote control, multi-arena, including it in stream, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    The controller was usually out of the way, and long USB cables for re-flashing the ESP32 combined with limited production-space requirements lead to a myriad of headaches.  
    This encouraged us to find something else, and I opted for a web-based solution.  This let us scale and re-arrange arena software and design as needed, even during unexpected event setup difficulties.
</p>
<p>
In short, it cost more time and effort for slower iteration.  Something bespoke software-wise still be less effort.

<!-- end image insert. -->

<h2 id="reqs">So what does it <i>need</i> to do?</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>easy to iterate</li>
        <li>one arena is nearly the same effort as more than one arena</li>
        <li>easy for someone other than the creator to run it</li>
        <li>can be integrated to the webcast and venue hardware (TVs)</li>
        <li>expansion should be cheap and fast</li>
        <li>needs to be able to be run entirely offline (no internet)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Choices</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python + Flask (No longer needing dedicated hardware, tooling I know and have worked with.) </li>
        <li>Uses TCP/IP and/or Websockets via <a href="https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">socket.io</a> (allows it to survive network issues.)</li>
        <li>Webpages in fullscreen or browser source in <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS.</a> (allows the timer to be visible on stream more easily.)</li>
        <li>Lightweight enough to run on a RPi or a laptop running the stream should it be needed.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 id="use">Using Bracketeer</h2>
<p>Bracketeer, a tool for those who bracket (running the tournament matches) has a few major viewmodes, all of which were made to help users save time and effort.</p>

</div>
<!-- end image insert. -->

<h3 id="queue">Queueing</h3>
<p>
    A major pain point for this and <a href="https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/are-queuers-necessary/411835">other robot sports</a> alike is knowing how much time you have before you are next actively in a match.  
    This is sometimes called "turnaround time", but "late or not" was what it usually became at events.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://truefinals.com/">TrueFinals</a>, the bracketing software GSCRL now uses, handles a decent portion of queueing information for us, but it has rough edges, largely involving multiple tournaments existing concurrently for the same "real" event.
</p>

    <div class="image-container">

    </div>
    <div class="image-container"><i>An example of what the preview would look like on a high resolution screen at tournaments prior, something we didn't have.</i></div>
</div>

<p>
    For example, with three weightclasses of combat robot, we were forced to have three distinct "tournaments" and switch between their views, adding friction and letting competitors more easily miss information. 
</p>

<p>
    As such, we'd prioritized a visible, information-dense overlay that can be viewed from anywhere on the arena network.
</p>

<p>
    By making the upcoming matches easy to see, and how long they'd been aware of said match, and all competitors are able to manage their own timelines without asking other volunteers or competitors.  It saves <i>everyone</i> time, frustration, and effort.
</p>

</div>
<!-- end image insert. -->

<h3 id="match-ctrl">Match Control</h3>

<p>We stated that a major criteria of the tool we're building (and already built!) is that it needs to be able to run more than one arena easily.  This is where the Match Control page comes in.</p>

<p>While many events only run one arena, GSCRL opts to run two sometimes due to the number of competitors.  As such, the timer controls for each arena can be delegated to a referee, judge, or production volunteer, minimizing the risk of one arena's timer being conflated for another.</p>

    <div class="image-container">

    </div>
    <div class="image-container"><i>The layout the arena controller or production volunteer uses, and makes their life easier.</i></div>
</div>
<!-- end image insert. -->

<p>
    The left pane is for timer controls, starting, stopping, or manually setting the match timer.  by default there's a countdown built in from 3 to 0 seconds, and then 150 seconds of match play, with optional warning sounds played on stream and via the arena screens specifically.
</p>

<div>
    <div class="image-container">
        <!-- Image goes here. -->
         <img src="img/control-timer.png">
    </div>
</div>
<!-- end image insert. -->

<p>The message box also allows for custom information to be rendered on the timer displays for competitors, enabling things like "matches resume at 1PM" to be said.</p>

<div>
    <div class="image-container">

<!-- end image insert. -->

<p>The sound test, hide timer, set cage unsafe, and set cage safe buttons are all shorthand for items that can be done otherwise with the menu tools present.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sound test plays a sound on all visible timer screens, ensuring that they can be heard by competitors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hide Timer send a message with no contents to the screen, hiding any timer that might be visible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set cage unsafe or safe changes the message and background color, used to manually flag whether a competitor can open the arena door or not.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>   

<p>
    The <i>right</i> pane however, has some novelty and minutae that can at a glance give production crew better information faster.  
</p>

<!-- end image insert. -->


<p>
    Taking inspiration from the Queueing screen, the list of upcoming matches is visible, as well as hyperlinks to the competitor's path through the tournament so far.  This enables any announcers or emcees to have easier access to the data they might need or want to help build an entertaining narrative.<sup><a href="#A-1">[A-1]</a><sup>
</p>
<p>
    If the time since match was called is under 20 minutes, it's in orange.  If it's marked as active or past the 20 minute buffer time, it turns red and shows a danger glyph next to it.
</p>

<h3 id="quirks">Quirks</h3>

<p>Despite quite a few iterations of software, there exist some quirks in how Bracketeer ingests and handles data.</p>
<p>Notably, the quirks exist in the control page, and with how TrueFinals data is retrieved.</p>
<p>It's possible for repeatedly polling the TrueFinals API to cause rate limit exhaustion.   The naive (but functional) resolution was to make a least-recently used cache that validates whether the rate limit is exhausted or not yet, and potentially returns (intentionally) stale data matching that endpoint to avoid any malformed data rendering or crashes.</p>

<p>At the time, I had no way of knowing the server crashing was due to rate limiting as it wasn't included in the TrueFinals' API Docs.  After a quick chat with Tom (the developer of TrueFinals), he'd told me that information on how exhausted the rate limit was could be found in response headers.<sup><a href="#A-2">[A-2]</a><sup></sup></p>

<pre>
    <code>
'x-ratelimit-limit': '10',
'x-ratelimit-remaining': '8',
'x-ratelimit-reset': '1736225420000',
'x-vercel-cache': 'MISS', 
'x-vercel-id': ' [ removed ]',
'transfer-encoding': 'chunked'</code>
</pre>


<hr>

<p>
    The other major architectural decision that's known is how the timer itself functions.
</p>
<p>
    Because I wasn't <i>absolutely</i> sure how consistent or deterministic the timer would be, I wanted the production folks to be able to manually call out timer information on the off-chance it broke somehow.  This lead to the timer being <i>client side</i>.  </p>
<p>
    This means that any timer <i>recipients</i> have to deal with the latency of client <--> sockets.io server <--> all timer clients.  This round trip <i>inherently</i> adds latency, and while I did attempt to make the timer library keep to < 1/10th of a second, it also means to make the timer jitter less that all clients should be connected via Ethernet.</p>
</p>

<p>In the future, I'd love to move the timer to a per-client basis with remote controls (start/stop/jitter calculations borrowed from NTP) sent via the socket.io connection.  As of yet though (2025/02/12), that work hasn't been done.</p>


</p>
<h4 id="debug">Debug Tools</h4>

<p>Hidden in Bracketeer's codebase include some tools that I use to evaluate functionality and status (and while subject to change, may be interesting), like the <a href="img/debug/clients.png">clients page</a> (showing all current socket.io clients and their open location) or the <a href="img/debug/requests.png">requests cache view</a> (showing the last requests as internal to the database of the running server.)</p>

<h2 id="where-to">The Setup As It Is</h2>

<p>
    While there exist quite a few places I'd like to keep evolving Bracketeer as my skillset grows, moving from Philadelphia to Chicago has inevitably put a small damper on things.  Until I get involved in a more local league (MRCA for example) it's unlikely I'll spend the time and effort on Bracketeer.
</p>
<p>Some of those low-hanging fruit, you might ask?  Well:</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>I'd like to built in Challonge support.  it's the main other bracket tool that robot events use in the combat space and not having it plays to my tool's detriment.</li>
        <li>I'd like to have automatic source/video splitting via OBS and OBS-DistroAV (NDI Plugin) so that match videos can be automagically timestamped and uploaded during the event.  (This also makes it more similar to <a href="https://brettzone.nhrl.io/brettZone/">NHRL's BrettZone</a>)</li>
        <li>I'd like the timers to be per-client, and have a better status-check for cage display connections and minimum latencies visible for diagnostics.  That way if a competitor's timer vanishes, I know about it.</li>
        <li>Self-Hosted Pi Image (so that it can be as easy as flashing an image and using it for other leagues to use)</li>
        <li> and more. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Right now any league can take the <a href="https://github.com/GSCRL/bracketeer">code we've put together</a> and use it for their own league.  The quirks mentioned before still do apply, but it's also open-source.  Anyone can contribute and <a href="https://github.com/GSCRL/bracketeer/pulls">pull-requests</a> are welcome.</p>

<h3>Personal Aside</h3>
<p>
    Thank you to everyone at GSCRL and at FUBAR Labs for letting me tinker and grow with the league.  It's been an honor working with you, and I can't wait to see what y'all come up with next.
</p>
