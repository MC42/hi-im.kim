    <h1>Elytra Project Log</h1>
    <p>This contains the ramblings, sporadic notes, and thoughts as I work on the Elytra scanning microscope.</p>

    <h2> Inspiration</h2>
    <p>This project was largely inspired by the designs as used in <a href="https://github.com/yuji3w/ladybug">Ladybug</a>, <a href="">Ladybug BEEFY</a>, and other microscope photography projects, such as those by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@timonsku/109651576348159021">@timonsku@mastodon.social</a>.</p>
    <h2>Software</h2></h2>
    <p>While it would be easy for me to use Python for this project, and to use Flask & its associated templating engines for getting remote control, the OpenCV Python bindings for super-resolution don't seem to exist in Python at time of writing.  However, Rust's bindgen ones, <i>do</i>.</p>
    <p>As such, I've been tinkering with those bindings, and looking at how the <code>opencv::superres::{*}</code> contents work.</p>

    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
    <p>This project will make heavy use of amateur skill FFF/FDM printing, due to both having a machine, and making it trivially reproducible for other tinkerers who may find this project useful.</p>
