<p>I'm recording this to try and get a grip on what I've been seeing.  As a seasoned astronomer, I'm beginning to wonder why my parents taught me all those years ago how to use a telescope.  Since about three weeks ago, I've been followed and scouted and prodded.  I'll cut to the chase, for my own sanity.</p>

<p>I'm being stalked by a UFO.  It's a low flying craft, about twenty feet across, silver and nondescript, hovering just out of my vision.  I mean, that's how UFOs normally look, right?  I catch it in reflections, car doors, the normal.  When I manage to get it in sight, I throw stuff at it, to try and verify... my sanity I guess?  I probably shouldn't have skipped that psych class back in college.  I hit it with a rock three days ago, it making a hollow resonating sound being sent out, like a bell.</p>

<p>Harry put down the pen, hearing a knock at his window.  He quietly got up, grabbing a stone off of his desk, turning it slowly in his hand.  Stepping slowly towards the window, he ripped open the curtains to see the silver ship, right in front of him.  Lurching backwards, he dove backwards and smacked his head on the door behind his bed.

<p>"What the hell is going on!?" he said to no-one in particular.  He heard a muffled voice outside  "Honey, open up!" she shouted.  "Mom?" he shouted, tears forming on his face.  Quickly wiping them off his face, he grabbed his notebook and pen, shakily writing a message, part diary, part last will and testment.</p>

<p>Maybe I *am* going crazy.  A window had opened up in the craft, with Mom and Dad standing *right there* in the distance.  "Sorry Honey, we'll be right in, okay?" they yelled, before setting the ship to land, I guess.  I put my turning stone in my pocket, fidgeting with it while thinking for a moment, and slowly went downstairs to see my parents.</p>

<p>"Harry sweetie, come on down!  We have so much to talk about!" his mother shouted up the stairs.  "Coming" Harry yelled down the stairs, grabbing his standard issue plasma-phaser and insignia.  "Next time you go off-world, make sure to let me know so they don't report you dead in some freak accident, okay?" he yelled, running down the stairs, past the framed photo of his parents, a small decal stating quietly:</p>

<p>"George and Karen Williams: Died 2109, Forever Missed"</p>
