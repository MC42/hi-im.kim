<h3><i>Preface</i></h3>
<p>The shop was a mess,
then of course, it always was.  Students were hustling to and fro
working on resurrecting old robots, others putting final touches on
benefits to be sent to sponsors, programmers resolving errors.  Of
course, this wasn’t the shop of some company designing some
magnificent future, or the hallowed halls of MIT.  But it started
there.<br/>
<br/>
In 1981, Dr. (then professor) Woodie Flowers
started the “2.70” course at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.  The contents were simple, of course, “Introduction to
Design”.  Students were to apply the principles they slaved over in
their other classes and lectures, to solve a specific task set out
before them.  The class grew more and more, turning out crowds and
becoming one of the most popular activities at the laureled
university, drawing the attention of a one Dean Kamen.</p>

<p >Dean Kamen was a tinkerer at heart, a genius by record, and a world changer by
intention.  His most popular invention, the Segway, became a cultural
joke, relegated to mall-cops and niche transport.  However, his most
significant was that of an organization called FIRST.  In his day
job, running an engineering firm called DEKA, he found people huddled
in his foyer during one rainy day, but was ultimately disheartened by
them not being there to marvel at machines, but just to escape the
rain.  He set out to build something as exciting as sports, and as
educational as the lectures so many barely sat through back at MIT.</p>

</p>
<p >Dr. Flowers and Dean Kamen ultimately ended up creating something far bigger than they had
ever imagined, giving birth to the FIRST Robotics Competition.  High
school students around the world have six weeks to build a robot to
compete in an international robotics competition with the eventual
goal of making it to (and winning) the FIRST Championship.  However,
as many things in life, it’s never quite so simple.</p>

</p>
<p >The bustling lab, as drills and saws whirred, was that of FRC team 1257, a spirited team
nestled in the center of New Jersey, enthusiastic, and worried.  How
could someone prepare for such a difficult task, of unknown nature? 
How far would preparedness and practice take them?  FIRST has been
known to give teams difficult, but not impossible challenges.  The
answer of course, was not quite so simple. But they had to try.</p>
